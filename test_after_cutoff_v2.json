{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD013388.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To evaluate the effects of CR on everyday functioning and other outcomes for people with mild\u2010to\u2010moderate dementia, and on outcomes for care partners. To identify and explore factors that may be associated with the efficacy of CR. \n\nMain results:\n We identified six eligible RCTs published in English between 2010 and 2022, which together included 1702 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 76 to 80 and the proportion of male participants was between 29.4% and 79.3%. Most participants, in the studies where the type of dementia was reported, had a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD; n = 1002, 58.9% of the whole sample, 81.2% of the participants for whom the specific diagnosis was reported). Risk of bias in the individual studies was relatively low. The exception was a high risk of bias in relation to blinding of participants and practitioners, which is not usually feasible with psychosocial interventions.  Our primary outcome of everyday functioning was operationalised in the included studies as goal attainment in relation to activities targeted in the intervention. For our main comparison of CR with usual care, we pooled data for goal attainment evaluated from three perspectives (self\u2010rating of performance, informant rating of performance, and self\u2010rating of satisfaction with performance) at end of treatment and at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 to 12 months). We could also pool data at these time points for 20 and 19 secondary outcomes respectively. The review findings were strongly driven by one large, high\u2010quality RCT.  We found high\u2010certainty evidence of large positive effects of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives at the end of treatment: participant self\u2010ratings of goal attainment (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26 to 1.66; I 2  = 0%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21; I 2  = 41%; 3 RCTs, 476 participants), and self\u2010ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I 2  = 5%; 3 RCTs, 501 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. At medium\u2010term follow\u2010up, we found high\u2010certainty evidence showing a large positive effect of CR on all three primary outcome perspectives: participant self\u2010ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.46, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.68; I 2  = 0%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), informant ratings of goal attainment (SMD 1.25, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; I 2  = 29%; 3 RCTs, 446 participants), and self\u2010ratings of satisfaction with goal attainment (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.66; I 2  = 28%; 2 RCTs, 432 participants), relative to an inactive control condition. For participants at the end of treatment we found high\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on self\u2010efficacy (2 RCTs, 456 participants) and immediate recall (2 RCTs, 459 participants). For participants at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up we found moderate\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on auditory selective attention (2 RCTs, 386 participants), and a small negative effect on general functional ability (3 RCTs, 673 participants), and we found low\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on sustained attention (2 RCTs, 413 participants), and a small negative effect on memory (2 RCTs, 51 participants) and anxiety (3 RCTs, 455 participants).  We found moderate\u2010 and low\u2010certainty evidence indicating that at the end of treatment CR had negligible effects on participant anxiety, quality of life, sustained attention, memory, delayed recall, and general functional ability, and at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up on participant self\u2010efficacy, depression, quality of life, immediate recall, and verbal fluency. For care partners at the end of treatment we found low\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on environmental aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 465 care partners), and small negative effects of CR on level of depression (2 RCTs, 32 care partners) and on psychological wellbeing (2 RCTs, 388 care partners).  For care partners at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up we found high\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect of CR on social aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 436 care partners) and moderate\u2010certainty evidence showing a small positive effect on psychological aspects of quality of life (3 RCTs, 437 care partners). We found moderate\u2010 and low\u2010certainty evidence at the end of treatment that CR had negligible effects on care partners\u2019 physical health, psychological and social aspects of quality of life, and stress, and at medium\u2010term follow\u2010up for the physical health aspect of care partners\u2019 quality of life and psychological wellbeing. ", "conclusion": " CR is helpful in enabling people with mild or moderate dementia to improve their ability to manage the everyday activities targeted in the intervention. Confidence in these findings could be strengthened if more high\u2010quality studies contributed to the observed effects. The available evidence suggests that CR can form a valuable part of a clinical toolkit to assist people with dementia in overcoming some of the everyday barriers imposed by cognitive and functional difficulties. Future research, including process evaluation studies, could help identify avenues to maximise CR effects and achieve wider impacts on functional ability and wellbeing.  "}

The comparator was usual care with no element of social support (i.e. secondary prevention alone or with cardiac rehabilitation).  \n\nMain results:\n We included 54 RCTs (126 publications) reporting data for a total of 11,445 people with heart disease. The median follow\u2010up was seven months and median sample size was 96 participants. Of included study participants, 6414 (56%) were male, and the mean age ranged from 48.6 to 76.3 years. Studies included heart failure (41%), mixed cardiac disease (31%), post\u2010myocardial infarction (13%), post\u2010revascularisation (7%), CHD (7%), and cardiac X syndrome (1%) patients. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks. We identified notable diversity in social network and social support interventions, across what was delivered, how, and by whom.  We assessed risk of bias (RoB) in primary outcomes at > 12 months follow\u2010up as either 'low' (2/15 studies), 'some concerns' (11/15), or 'high' (2/15). 'Some concerns' or 'high' RoB resulted from insufficient detail on blinding of outcome assessors, data missingness, and absence of pre\u2010agreed statistical analysis plans. In particular, HRQoL outcomes were at high RoB. Using the GRADE method, we assessed the certainty of evidence as low or very low across outcomes. Social network or social support interventions had no clear effect on all\u2010cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.13, I 2  = 40%) or cardiovascular\u2010related mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.10, I 2  = 0%) at > 12 months follow\u2010up. The evidence suggests that social network or social support interventions for heart disease may result in little to no difference in all\u2010cause hospital admission (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.22, I 2  = 0%), or cardiovascular\u2010related hospital admission (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10, I 2  = 16%), with a low level of certainty. The evidence was very uncertain regarding the impact of social network interventions on HRQoL at > 12 months follow\u2010up (SF\u201036 physical component score: mean difference (MD) 31.53, 95% CI \u201028.65 to 91.71, I 2  = 100%, 2 trials/comparisons, 166 participants; mental component score MD 30.62, 95% CI \u201033.88 to 95.13, I 2  = 100%, 2 trials/comparisons, 166 participants).  Regarding secondary outcomes, there may be a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with social network or social support interventions. There was no evidence of impact found on psychological well\u2010being, smoking, cholesterol, myocardial infarction, revascularisation, return to work/education, social isolation or connectedness, patient satisfaction, or adverse events.  Results of meta\u2010regression did not suggest that the intervention effect was related to risk of bias, intervention type, duration, setting, and delivery mode, population type, study location, participant age, or percentage of male participants.  ", "conclusion": " We found no strong evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions, although modest effects were identified in relation to blood pressure. While the data presented in this review are indicative of potential for positive effects, the review also highlights the lack of sufficient evidence to conclusively support such interventions for people with heart disease. Further high\u2010quality, well\u2010reported RCTs are required to fully explore the potential of social support interventions in this context. Future reporting of social network and social support interventions for people with heart disease needs to be significantly clearer, and more effectively theorised, in order to ascertain causal pathways and effect on outcomes.

We found moderate\u2010certainty evidence (limited by heterogeneity) that cytisine helps more people to quit smoking than placebo (RR 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.47; I 2  = 83%; 4 studies, 4623 participants), and no evidence of a difference in the number reporting SAEs (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 3781 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

Pooled results from studies that randomised people to receive cytisine or varenicline found no clear evidence of difference in quit rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.26; I 2  = 65%; 2 studies, 2131 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and reported SAEs (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; I 2  = 45%; 2 studies, 2017 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, the evidence was limited by imprecision, and confidence intervals incorporated the potential for benefit from either cytisine or varenicline. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs. We found high\u2010certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than bupropion (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.49; I 2  = 0%; 9 studies, 7560 participants), and no clear evidence of difference in rates of SAEs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 5317 participants), neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.04; I 2  = 10%; 2 studies, 866 participants), or cardiac SAEs (RR 3.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 30.18; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 866 participants). Evidence of harms was of low certainty, limited by imprecision. We found high\u2010certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than a single form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.37; I 2  = 28%; 11 studies, 7572 participants), and low\u2010certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, of fewer reported SAEs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; I 2  = 24%; 6 studies, 6535 participants). We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs. We found no clear evidence of a difference in quit rates between varenicline and dual\u2010form NRT (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 2344 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded because of imprecision).

Varenicline is more effective at helping people to quit smoking than bupropion, or a single form of NRT, and may be as or more effective than dual\u2010form NRT. People taking varenicline are probably more likely to experience SAEs than those not taking it, and while there may be increased risk of cardiac SAEs and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric SAEs, evidence was compatible with both benefit and harm. Cytisine may lead to fewer people reporting SAEs than varenicline. Based on studies that directly compared cytisine and varenicline, there may be no difference or a benefit from either medication for quitting smoking. Future trials should test the effectiveness and safety of cytisine compared with varenicline and other pharmacotherapies, and should also test variations in dose and duration. There is limited benefit to be gained from more trials testing the effect of standard\u2010dose varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation. Further trials on varenicline should test variations in dose and duration, and compare varenicline with e\u2010cigarettes for smoking cessation. "}

One study that investigated ranibizumab versus sham and one study that mainly enrolled people with subclinical DMO and normal BCVA were not suitable for inclusion in the efficacy NMA. Consistent with the previous update of this review, we used ranibizumab as the reference drug for efficacy, and control (including laser, observation, and sham) as the reference for systemic safety. Eight trials provided data on the primary outcome (change in BCVA at 24 months, in logMAR: lower is better). We found no evidence of a difference between the following interventions and ranibizumab alone: aflibercept (mean difference (MD) \u22120.05 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.12 to 0.02; moderate certainty); bevacizumab (MD \u20100.01 logMAR, 95% CI \u22120.13 to 0.10; low certainty), brolucizumab (MD 0.00 logMAR, 95% CI \u22120.08 to 0.07; low certainty), ranibizumab plus deferred laser (MD 0.00 logMAR, 95% CI \u22120.11 to 0.10; low certainty), and ranibizumab plus prompt laser (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.09; very low certainty).  We also analysed BCVA change at 12 months, finding moderate\u2010certainty evidence of increased efficacy with brolucizumab (MD \u22120.07 logMAR, 95%CI \u22120.10 to \u22120.03 logMAR), faricimab (MD \u22120.08 logMAR, 95% CI \u22120.12 to \u22120.05), and aflibercept (MD \u22120.07 logMAR, 95 % CI \u22120.10 to \u22120.04) compared to ranibizumab alone, but the difference could be clinically insignificant.  Compared to ranibizumab alone, NMA of six trials showed no evidence of a difference with aflibercept (moderate certainty), bevacizumab (low certainty), or ranibizumab with prompt (very low certainty) or deferred laser (low certainty) regarding improvement by three or more ETDRS lines at 24 months. There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence of greater CRT reduction at 24 months with brolucizumab (MD \u221223 microns, 95% CI \u221265 to \u22121 9) and aflibercept (MD \u221226 microns, 95% CI \u221253 to 0.9) compared to ranibizumab. There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence of lesser CRT reduction with bevacizumab (MD 28 microns, 95% CI 0 to 56), ranibizumab plus deferred laser (MD 63 microns, 95% CI 18 to 109), and ranibizumab plus prompt laser (MD 72 microns, 95% CI 25 to 119) compared with ranibizumab alone. Regarding all\u2010cause mortality at the longest available follow\u2010up (20 trials), we found no evidence of increased risk of death for any drug compared to control, although effects were in the direction of an increase, and clinically relevant increases could not be ruled out. The certainty of this evidence was low for bevacizumab (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 5.88), brolucizumab (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.68 to 12.58), faricimab (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.45 to 8.00), ranibizumab (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34), and very low for conbercept (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.81) and aflibercept (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.77). Estimates for Antiplatelet Trialists Collaboration arterial thromboembolic events at 24 months did not suggest an increase with any drug compared to control, but the NMA was overall incoherent and the evidence was of low or very low certainty.

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on pain assessed with other pain scores or at different time points. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on episodes of bradycardia, hypotension or severe apnea. Opioids may result in an increase in episodes of apnea. No studies reported parent satisfaction with care provided in the NICU. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of opioids on any outcome when compared to non\u2010pharmacological interventions or to other analgesics.

Overall, the studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. In 16 studies the authors reported financial links with the manufacturer of the laser platform evaluated in their studies. Thirteen of the studies were within\u2010person (paired\u2010eye) studies with one eye allocated to one procedure and the other eye allocated to the other procedure. These studies were reported ignoring the paired nature of the data. There was low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference in the odds of developing anterior capsular tears when comparing FLACS and PCS (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.72; 5835 eyes, 27 studies) There was one fewer anterior capsule tear per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 4 fewer to 3 more).  There was low\u2010certainty evidence of lower odds of developing posterior capsular tears with FLACS compared to PCS (Peto OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.00; 5767 eyes, 26 studies). There were four fewer posterior capsule tears per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 6 fewer to same).  There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence of a very small advantage for the FLACS arm with regard to CDVA at six months or more follow\u2010up, (mean difference (MD) \u20100.01 logMAR, 95% CI \u20100.02 to 0.00; 1323 eyes, 7 studies). This difference is equivalent to 1 logMAR letter between groups and is not thought to be clinically important. From the three studies (1205 participants) reporting a variety of PROMs (Cat\u2010PROMS, EQ\u20105D, EQ\u2010SD\u20103L, Catquest9\u2010SF and patient survey) up to three months following surgery, there was moderate\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference in the various parameters between the two treatment arms. There was low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference in the odds of developing cystoid macular oedema when comparing FLACS and PCS (Peto OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28; 4441 eyes, 18 studies). There were three fewer cystoid macular oedema cases per 1000 operations in the FLACS group compared with the PCS group (95% CI 10 fewer to 6 more).  In one study the incremental cost\u2010effectiveness ratio (ICER) (cost difference divided by quality\u2010adjusted life year (QALY) difference) was GBP \u00a3167,620 when comparing FLACS to PCS. In another study, the ICER was EUR \u20ac10,703 saved per additional patient who had treatment success with PCS compared to FLACS. Duration ranged from three minutes in favour of FLACS to eight minutes in favour of PCS (I 2  = 100%, 11 studies) (low\u2010certainty evidence).  There was low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no important difference in endothelial cell loss when comparing FLACS with PCS (MD 12 cells per mm 2  in favour of FLACS, 95% CI \u201040 to 64; 1512 eyes, 10 studies).  ", "conclusion": " This review of 42 studies provides evidence that there is probably little or no difference between FLACS and PCS in terms of intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative visual acuity and quality of life. Evidence from two studies suggests that FLACS may be the less cost\u2010effective option. Many of the included studies only investigated very specific outcome measures such as effective phacoemulsification time, endothelial cell count change or aqueous flare, rather than those directly related to patient outcomes. Standardised reporting of complications and visual and refractive outcomes for cataract surgery would facilitate future synthesis, and guidance on this has been recently published.  "}

There was no report of any rare but serious adverse effects, such as venous thromboembolism in any of the included studies. COCs containing drospirenone may improve response rate (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.40; 1 RCT, N = 449; I 2  not applicable; low\u2010quality evidence).

We included 27 studies (of which 9 were new) involving a total of 4656 participants, 19 studies comparing  Serenoa repens  with placebo, and 8 studies comparing  Serenoa repens  in combination with other phytotherapeutic agents versus placebo. Most studies included men aged > 50 (mean age range 52 to 68) with moderate urologic symptoms (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] range 8 to 19). Ten studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry; two studies were funded by government agencies; and the remaining studies did not specify funding sources. Serenoa repens  versus placebo or no intervention Results for this comparison are based on predefined sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias.  Serenoa repens  results in little to no difference in urologic symptoms at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (3 to 6 months; IPSS score range 0 to 35, higher scores indicate worse symptoms; mean difference (MD) \u22120.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22121.74 to \u22120.07; I 2  = 68%; 9 studies, 1681 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence).

There were no data on long\u2010term adverse events for this comparison. Serenoa repens  in combination with other phytotherapy versus placebo or no intervention Different phytotherapeutic agents that include  Serenoa repens  may result in little to no difference in urologic symptoms compared to placebo at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (12 to 24 weeks, IPSS score, MD \u22122.41, 95% CI \u22124.54 to \u22120.29; I 2  = 67%; 4 studies, 460 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effects of these agents on quality of life (very low\u2010certainty evidence). These agents may result in little to no difference in the occurrence of adverse events; however, the CIs included substantial benefits and harms (12 to 48 weeks, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 481 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

We included only one study from the previous version of this review, following a revision of inclusion criteria. We listed five studies as 'awaiting classification' and one study as 'ongoing'. Of the 10 included studies, seven compared low GI/GL diets (233 participants) with higher GI/GL diets (222 participants) and three studies compared low GI/GL diets (379 participants) with any other diet (376 participants). One study included children (50 participants); one study included adults aged over 65 years (24 participants); the remaining studies included adults (1136 participants). The duration of the interventions varied from eight weeks to 18 months. All trials had an unclear or high risk of bias across several domains.  Low GI/GL diets versus higher GI/GL diets Low GI/GL diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight compared to higher GI/GL diets (mean difference (MD) \u20100.82 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.92 to 0.28; I 2  = 52%; 7 studies, 403 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence from four studies reporting change in body mass index (BMI) indicated low GI/GL diets may result in little to no difference in change in BMI compared to higher GI/GL diets (MD \u20100.45 kg/m 2 , 95% CI \u20101.02 to 0.12; I 2  = 22%; 186 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence)at the end of the study periods. One study assessing participants' mood indicated that low GI/GL diets may improve mood compared to higher GI/GL diets, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD \u20103.5, 95% CI \u20109.33 to 2.33; 42 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies assessing adverse events did not report any adverse events; we judged this outcome to have very low\u2010certainty evidence. No studies reported on all\u2010cause mortality.    For the secondary outcomes, low GI/GL diets may result in little to no difference in fat mass compared to higher GI/GL diets (MD \u20100.86 kg, 95% CI \u20101.52 to \u20100.20; I 2  = 6%; 6 studies, 295 participants; low certainty\u2010evidence).

Low GI/GL diets versus any other diet Low GI/GL diets probably result in little to no difference in change in body weight compared to other diets (MD \u20101.24 kg, 95% CI \u20102.82 to 0.34; I 2  = 70%; 3 studies, 723 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

Two adverse events were reported in one study: one was not related to the intervention, and the other, an eating disorder, may have been related to the intervention. Another study reported 11 adverse events, including hypoglycaemia following an oral glucose tolerance test. The same study reported seven serious adverse events, including kidney stones and diverticulitis. We judged this outcome to have low\u2010certainty evidence. No studies reported on health\u2010related quality of life or all\u2010cause mortality. For the secondary outcomes, none of the studies reported on fat mass. Low GI/GL diets probably do not reduce fasting blood glucose level compared to other diets (MD 0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI \u20100.05 to 0.12; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 732 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

All participants had a diagnosis of advanced cancer. With the exception of 29 participants who had a haematological malignancy, all others were solid organ cancers. Two studies each compared MAH to placebo and standard care. There were too few included studies to evaluate different subgroups, such as type of participant, intervention, timing of intervention, and study site. We considered one study to be at high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding; otherwise, risk of bias was assessed as low or unclear.

We are uncertain about the effect on relief of overall pain, when a subdivision was made for overall pain (MD \u20100.30; 95% CI \u20101.66 to 1.06, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence), pelvic pain (MD 0.20; 95% CI \u20100.26 to 0.66, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence), dysmenorrhoea (MD 0.10; 95% CI \u20100.49 to 0.69, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence), dyspareunia (MD \u20100.20; 95% CI \u20100.77 to 0.37, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence), pelvic induration (MD \u20100.10; 95% CI \u20100.59 to 0.39, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence), and pelvic tenderness (MD \u20100.20; 95% CI \u20100.78 to 0.38, 1 RCT, n = 41, very low\u2010certainty evidence) after three months of treatment.

", "conclusion": " For relief of overall pain, there may be a slight decrease in favour of treatment with GnRHas compared to placebo or oral or injectable progestogens. We are uncertain about the effect when comparing GnRHas with danazol, intra\u2010uterine progestogens or gestrinone. For BMD, there may be a slight decrease when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to gestrinone. There was a bigger decrease of BMD in favour of GnRHas, compared to GnRHas in conjunction with calcium\u2010regulating agents. However, there may be a slight increase in adverse effects when women are treated with GnRHas, compared to placebo or gestrinone. Due to a very low to low certainty of the evidence, a wide range of outcome measures and a wide range of outcome measurement instruments, the results should be interpreted with caution.  "}

We categorised the included studies as testing light vibrational forces or photobiomodulation, the latter including low level laser therapy and light emitting diode. The studies assessed non\u2010surgical interventions added to fixed or removable orthodontic appliances compared to treatment without the adjunct. A total of 1027 participants (children and adults) were recruited with loss to follow\u2010up ranging from 0% to 27% of the original samples.  Certainty of the evidence For all comparisons and outcomes presented below, the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. Light vibrational forces  Eleven studies assessed how applying light vibrational forces (LVF) affected orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). There was no evidence of a difference between the intervention and control groups for duration of orthodontic treatment (MD \u20100.61 months, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20102.44 to 1.22; 2 studies, 77 participants); total number of orthodontic appliance adjustment visits (MD \u20100.32 visits, 95% CI \u20101.69 to 1.05; 2 studies, 77 participants); orthodontic tooth movement during the early alignment stage (reduction of lower incisor irregularity (LII)) at 4\u20106 weeks (MD 0.12 mm, 95% CI \u20101.77 to 2.01; 3 studies, 144 participants), or 10\u201016 weeks (MD \u20100.18 mm, 95% CI \u20101.20 to 0.83; 4 studies, 175 participants); rate of canine distalisation (MD \u20100.01 mm/month, 95% CI \u20100.20 to 0.18; 2 studies, 40 participants); or rate of OTM during en masse space closure (MD 0.10 mm per month, 95% CI \u20100.08 to 0.29; 2 studies, 81 participants). No evidence of a difference was found between LVF and control groups in rate of OTM when using removable orthodontic aligners. Nor did the studies show evidence of a difference between groups for our secondary outcomes, including patient perception of pain, patient\u2010reported need for analgesics at different stages of treatment and harms or side effects.  Photobiomodulation Ten studies assessed the effect of applying  low level laser therapy  (LLLT) on rate of OTM. We found that participants in the LLLT group had a statistically significantly shorter length of time for the teeth to align in the early stages of treatment (MD \u201050 days, 95% CI \u201058 to \u201042; 2 studies, 62 participants) and required fewer appointments (\u20102.3, 95% CI \u20102.5 to \u20102.0; 2 studies, 125 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between the LLLT and control groups in OTM when assessed as percentage reduction in LII in the first month of alignment (1.63%, 95% CI \u20102.60 to 5.86; 2 studies, 56 participants) or in the second month (percentage reduction MD 3.75%, 95% CI \u20101.74 to 9.24; 2 studies, 56 participants). However, LLLT resulted in an increase in OTM during the space closure stage in the maxillary arch (MD 0.18 mm/month, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.33; 1 study; 65 participants; very low level of certainty) and the mandibular arch (right side MD 0.16 mm/month, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.19; 1 study; 65 participants). In addition, LLLT resulted in an increased  rate of OTM during maxillary canine retraction (MD 0.01 mm/month, 95% CI 0 to 0.02; 1 study, 37 participants). These  findings were not clinically significant. The studies showed no evidence of a difference between groups for our secondary outcomes, including OIIRR, periodontal health and patient perception of pain at early stages of treatment. Two studies assessed the influence of applying  light\u2010emitting diode  (LED) on OTM.

", "conclusion": " The evidence from randomised controlled trials concerning the effectiveness of non\u2010surgical interventions to accelerate orthodontic treatment is of low to very low certainty. It suggests that there is no additional benefit of light vibrational forces or photobiomodulation for reducing the duration of orthodontic treatment. Although there may be a limited benefit from photobiomodulation application for accelerating discrete treatment phases, these results have to be interpreted with caution due to their questionable clinical significance. Further well\u2010designed, rigorous RCTs with longer follow\u2010up periods spanning from start to completion of orthodontic treatment are required to determine whether non\u2010surgical interventions may reduce the duration of orthodontic treatment by a clinically significant amount, with minimal adverse effects.

Six RCTs were carried out in single centres; two in dual centres; and six in multiple centres. One RCT was conducted in Australia; one in Austria; two in France; three in Italy; one in Japan; two in the Netherlands; two in South Korea; and two in the USA.

Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.  There is high\u2010certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast\u2010acting form plus patch) results in higher long\u2010term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I 2  = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24\u2010hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I 2  = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24\u2010hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16\u2010hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I 2  = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High\u2010certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast\u2010acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long\u2010term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I 2  = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants).

Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low\u2010 or very low\u2010certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall.

", "conclusion": " There is high\u2010certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single\u2010form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower\u2010dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher\u2010dose products. Using a fast\u2010acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate\u2010certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported. "}

Routine monitoring versus no routine monitoring of gastric residual in preterm infants Four RCTs with 336 preterm infants met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. Three studies were performed in infants with birth weight of < 1500 g, while one study included infants with birth weight between 750 g and 2000 g. The trials were unmasked but were otherwise of good methodological quality. Routine monitoring of gastric residual:  \u2010 probably has little or no effect on the risk of NEC (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.57; 334 participants, 4 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 probably increases the time to establish full enteral feeds (MD 3.14 days, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.36; 334 participants, 4 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may increase the time to regain birth weight (MD 1.70 days, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.39; 80 participants, 1 study; low\u2010certainty evidence);  \u2010 may increase the number of infants with feed interruption episodes (RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.20; NNTH 3, 95% CI 2 to 5; 191 participants, 3 studies; low\u2010certainty evidence);  \u2010 probably increases the number of TPN days (MD 2.57 days, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.95; 334 participants, 4 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 probably increases the risk of invasive infection (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.19; NNTH 10, 95% CI 5 to 100; 334 participants, 4 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may result in little or no difference in all\u2010cause mortality before hospital discharge (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.77 to 5.97; 273 participants, 3 studies; low\u2010certainty evidence). Quality and volume of gastric residual compared to quality of gastric residual alone for feed interruption in preterm infants One trial with 87 preterm infants met the inclusion criteria for this comparison. The trial included infants with 1500 g to 2000 g birth weight.  Using two different criteria of gastric residual for feed interruption: \u2010 may result in little or no difference in the incidence of NEC (RR 5.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 108.27; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence);  \u2010 may result in little or no difference in time to establish full enteral feeds (MD \u20100.10 days, 95% CI \u20100.91 to 0.71; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may result in little or no difference in time to regain birth weight (MD 1.00 days, 95% CI \u20100.37 to 2.37; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may result in little or no difference in number of TPN days (MD 0.80 days, 95% CI \u20100.78 to 2.38; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may result in little or no difference in the risk of invasive infection (RR 5.35, 95% CI 0.26 to 108.27; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); \u2010 may result in little or no difference in all\u2010cause mortality before hospital discharge (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.67; 87 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  \u2010 we are uncertain about the effect of using two different criteria of gastric residual on the risk of feed interruption episodes (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 76.67; 87 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).

Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests monitoring gastric residual may increase the time to regain birth weight and the number of feed interruption episodes, and may have little or no effect on all\u2010cause mortality before hospital discharge.

This review evaluated global symptoms of functional dyspepsia, adverse events and quality of life; however, some studies did not report these outcomes. STW5 (Iberogast) may moderately improve global symptoms of dyspepsia compared with placebo at 28 to 56 days; however, the evidence is very uncertain (MD \u20102.64, 95% CI \u20104.39 to \u20100.90; I 2  = 87%; 5 studies, 814 participants; very low CoE).

There was little to no difference in adverse events for STW5 compared to placebo (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.64; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 786 participants; low CoE). STW5 may cause little to no difference in quality of life compared to placebo (no numerical data available, low CoE).

There is probably little to no difference in the rate of adverse events between this intervention and placebo (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.08; 1 study, 89 participants; moderate CoE).

Almost all the studies reported little to no difference in the rate of adverse events compared to placebo except for red pepper, which may result in a higher risk of adverse events compared to placebo (RR 4.31, 95% CI 1.56 to 11.89; 1 study, 27 participants; low CoE). With respect to the quality of life, most studies did not report this outcome. When compared to other interventions, essential oils may improve global symptoms of dyspepsia compared to omeprazole.

We judged 15 of the 24 included trials to have a high risk of bias due to participants' ability to discern the taste of the solutions. Hypertonic saline 3% to 7% versus placebo (stable disease) We are uncertain whether the regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline in stable lung disease leads to an improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted at four weeks, (mean difference (MD) 3.30%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 5.89; 4 trials, 246 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). In preschool children we found no difference in lung clearance index (LCI) at four weeks, but a small improvement after 48 weeks of treatment with hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD \u20100.60, 95% CI \u20101.00 to \u20100.19; 2 trials, 192 participants). We are also uncertain whether hypertonic saline made a difference to mucociliary clearance, pulmonary exacerbations or adverse events compared to placebo. Hypertonic saline versus control (acute exacerbation) Two trials compared hypertonic saline to control, but only one provided data. There may be little or no difference in lung function measured by FEV 1  % predicted after hypertonic saline compared to isotonic saline (MD 5.10%, 95% CI \u201014.67 to 24.87; 1 trial, 130 participants). Neither trial reported any deaths or measures of sputum clearance. There were no serious adverse events. Hypertonic saline versus rhDNase Three trials compared a similar dose of hypertonic saline to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (rhDNase); two trials (61 participants) provided data for inclusion in the review. We are uncertain whether there was an effect of hypertonic saline on FEV 1  % predicted after three weeks (MD 1.60%, 95% CI \u20107.96 to 11.16; 1 trial, 14 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). At three months, rhDNase may lead to a greater increase in FEV 1  % predicted than hypertonic saline (5 mL twice daily) at 12 weeks in participants with moderate to severe lung disease (MD 8.00%, 95% CI 2.00 to 14.00; low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether adverse events differed between the two treatments. No deaths were reported. Hypertonic saline versus amiloride One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to amiloride but did not report on most of our outcomes. The trial found that there was no difference between treatments in measures of sputum clearance (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline compared with sodium\u20102\u2010mercaptoethane sulphonate (Mistabron\u00ae) One trial (29 participants) compared hypertonic saline to sodium\u20102\u2010mercaptoethane sulphonate. The trial did not measure our primary outcomes. There was no difference between treatments in any measures of sputum clearance, courses of antibiotics or adverse events (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus mannitol One trial (12 participants) compared hypertonic saline to mannitol, but did not report lung function at relevant time points for this review; there were no differences in sputum clearance, but mannitol was reported to be more 'irritating' (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline versus xylitol Two trials compared hypertonic saline to xylitol, but we are uncertain whether there is any difference in FEV 1  % predicted or median time to exacerbation between groups (very low\u2010certainty evidence). No other outcomes were reported in the review. Hypertonic saline 7% versus hypertonic saline 3% We are uncertain whether there was an improvement in FEV 1  % predicted after treatment with 7% hypertonic saline compared with 3% (very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " We are very uncertain if regular use of nebulised hypertonic saline by adults and children over the age of 12 years with CF results in an improvement in lung function after four weeks (three trials; very low\u2010certainty evidence); there was no difference seen at 48 weeks (one trial; low\u2010certainty evidence). Hypertonic saline improved LCI modestly in children under the age of six years. Evidence from one small cross\u2010over trial in children indicates that rhDNase may lead to better lung function than hypertonic saline at three months; qualifying this, we highlight that while the study did demonstrate that the improvement in FEV 1  was greater with daily rhDNase, there were no differences seen in any of the secondary outcomes. Hypertonic saline does appear to be an effective adjunct to physiotherapy during acute exacerbations of lung disease in adults. However, for the outcomes assessed, the certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to low at best, according to the GRADE criteria. The role of hypertonic saline in conjunction with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator therapy now needs to be considered, and future research needs to focus on this aspect.

Nine evaluated intravitreal (IVT) administrations against sham, and one investigated an intravenous agent against placebo. Seven studies excluded patients with prior MNV in the non\u2010study eye, whereas the three pegcetacoplan studies did not. The risk of bias in the included studies was low overall. We also synthesised results of two intravitreal agents (lampalizumab, pegcetacoplan) at monthly and every\u2010other\u2010month (EOM) dosing intervals. Efficacy and safety of IVT lampalizumab versus sham for GA For 1932 participants in three studies, lampalizumab did not meaningfully change BCVA given monthly (+1.03 letters, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.19 to 2.25) or EOM (+0.22 letters, 95% CI \u22121.00 to 1.44) (high\u2010certainty evidence). For 1920 participants, lampalizumab did not meaningfully change GA lesion growth given monthly (+0.07 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.09 to 0.23; moderate\u2010certainty due to imprecision) or EOM (+0.07 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.19; high\u2010certainty). For 2000 participants, lampalizumab may have also increased MNV risk given monthly (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.30) and EOM (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.28), based on low\u2010certainty evidence. The incidence of endophthalmitis in patients treated with monthly and EOM lampalizumab was 4 per 1000 (0 to 87) and 3 per 1000 (0 to 62), respectively, based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Efficacy and safety of IVT pegcetacoplan versus sham for GA For 242 participants in one study, pegcetacoplan probably did not meaningfully change BCVA given monthly (+1.05 letters, 95% CI \u22122.71 to 4.81) or EOM (\u22121.42 letters, 95% CI \u22125.25 to 2.41), as supported by moderate\u2010certainty evidence. In contrast, for 1208 participants across three studies, pegcetacoplan meaningfully reduced GA lesion growth when given monthly (\u22120.38 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.57 to \u22120.19) and EOM (\u22120.29 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.44 to \u22120.13), with high certainty. These reductions correspond to 19.2% and 14.8% versus sham, respectively. A post hoc analysis showed possibly greater benefits in 446 participants with extrafoveal GA given monthly (\u22120.67 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.98 to \u22120.36) and EOM (\u22120.60 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22120.91 to \u22120.30), representing 26.1% and 23.3% reductions, respectively. However, we did not have data on subfoveal GA growth to undertake a formal subgroup analysis. In 1502 participants, there is low\u2010certainty evidence that pegcetacoplan may have increased MNV risk when given monthly (RR 4.47, 95% CI 0.41 to 48.98) or EOM (RR 2.29, 95% CI 0.46 to 11.35). The incidence of endophthalmitis in patients treated with monthly and EOM pegcetacoplan was 6 per 1000 (1 to 53) and 8 per 1000 (1 to 70) respectively, based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Efficacy and safety of IVT avacincaptad pegol versus sham for GA In a study of 260 participants with extrafoveal or juxtafoveal GA, monthly avacincaptad pegol probably did not result in a clinically meaningful change in BCVA at 2 mg (+1.39 letters, 95% CI \u22125.89 to 8.67) or 4 mg (\u22120.28 letters, 95% CI \u22128.74 to 8.18), based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Despite this, the drug was still found to have probably reduced GA lesion growth, with estimates of 30.5% reduction at 2 mg (\u22120.70 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22121.99 to 0.59) and 25.6% reduction at 4 mg (\u22120.71 mm\u00b2, 95% CI \u22121.92 to 0.51), based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Avacincaptad pegol may have also increased the risk of developing MNV (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 10.55), although this evidence is of low certainty. There were no cases of endophthalmitis reported in this study. ", "conclusion": " Despite confirmation of the negative findings of intravitreal lampalizumab across all endpoints, local complement inhibition with intravitreal pegcetacoplan meaningfully reduces GA lesion growth relative to sham at one year. Inhibition of complement C5 with intravitreal avacincaptad pegol is also an emerging therapy with probable benefits on anatomical endpoints in the extrafoveal or juxtafoveal GA population. However, there is currently no evidence that complement inhibition with any agent improves functional endpoints in advanced AMD; further results from the phase 3 studies of pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad pegol are eagerly awaited. Progression to MNV or exudative AMD is a possible emergent adverse event of complement inhibition, requiring careful consideration should these agents be used clinically. Intravitreal administration of complement inhibitors is probably associated with a small risk of endophthalmitis, which may be higher than that of other intravitreal therapies. Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of adverse effects and may change these. The optimal dosing regimens, treatment duration, and cost\u2010effectiveness of such therapies are yet to be established. "}

We assessed three studies to be at an overall unclear risk of bias, one study at overall high risk of bias, and one study at overall low risk of bias. We were not able to combine data in meta\u2010analysis as studies did not report all outcomes, and different methods were used to measure and report outcomes.

One study reported no differences between groups without presenting data. There was no clear difference between groups in exercise capacity measured as time on treadmill (baseline to six\u2010month changes) (MD \u22120.53 minutes, 95% CI \u22125.25 to 4.19; 35 participants, 1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence).

Of these 138 studies, we analysed 115 (9048 participants) and described 23 (2010 participants) qualitatively. We described qualitatively studies that could not be meta\u2010analysed due to being the only studies in their category or statistical reporting issues. We report the results of the 138 included studies here. An SMD effect size of 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect. The thresholds for the I 2  interpretation were established as follows: not important (0% to 40%); moderate heterogeneity (30% to 60%); substantial heterogeneity (50% to 90%); considerable heterogeneity (75% to 100%). The most commonly studied acute procedures were heel sticks (63 studies) and needlestick procedures for the purposes of vaccines/vitamins (35 studies). We judged most studies to have high risk of bias (103 out of 138), with the most common methodological concerns relating to blinding of personnel and outcome assessors. Pain responses were examined during two separate pain phases: pain reactivity (within the first 30 seconds after the acutely painful stimulus) and immediate pain regulation (after the first 30 seconds following the acutely painful stimulus). We report below the strategies with the strongest evidence base for each age group. In preterm born neonates, non\u2010nutritive sucking may reduce pain reactivity (SMD \u20100.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.03 to \u20100.11, moderate effect; I 2  = 93%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD \u20100.61, 95% CI \u20100.95 to \u20100.27, moderate effect; I 2  = 81%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low\u2010certainty evidence. Facilitated tucking may also reduce pain reactivity (SMD \u20101.01, 95% CI \u20101.44 to \u20100.58, large effect; I 2  = 93%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD \u20100.59, 95% CI \u20100.92 to \u20100.26, moderate effect; I 2  = 87%, considerable heterogeneity); however, this is also based on very low\u2010certainty evidence. While swaddling likely does not reduce pain reactivity in preterm neonates (SMD \u20100.60, 95% CI \u20101.23 to 0.04, no effect; I 2  = 91%, considerable heterogeneity), it has been shown to possibly improve immediate pain regulation (SMD \u20101.21, 95% CI \u20102.05 to \u20100.38, large effect; I 2  = 89%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low\u2010certainty evidence. In full\u2010term born neonates, non\u2010nutritive sucking may reduce pain reactivity (SMD \u20101.13, 95% CI \u20101.57 to \u20100.68, large effect; I 2  = 82%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD \u20101.49, 95% CI \u20102.20 to \u20100.78, large effect; I 2  = 92%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low\u2010certainty evidence.  In full\u2010term born older infants, structured parent involvement was the intervention most studied. Results showed that this intervention has little to no effect in reducing pain reactivity (SMD \u20100.18, 95% CI \u20100.40 to 0.03, no effect; I 2  = 46%, moderate heterogeneity) or improving immediate pain regulation (SMD \u20100.09, 95% CI \u20100.40 to 0.21, no effect; I 2  = 74%, substantial heterogeneity), based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Of these five interventions most studied, only two studies observed adverse events, specifically vomiting (one preterm neonate) and desaturation (one full\u2010term neonate hospitalised in the NICU) following the non\u2010nutritive sucking intervention. The presence of considerable heterogeneity limited our confidence in the findings for certain analyses, as did the preponderance of evidence of very low to low certainty based on GRADE judgements. ", "conclusion": " Overall, non\u2010nutritive sucking, facilitated tucking, and swaddling may reduce pain behaviours in preterm born neonates. Non\u2010nutritive sucking may also reduce pain behaviours in full\u2010term neonates. No interventions based on a substantial body of evidence showed promise in reducing pain behaviours in older infants. Most analyses were based on very low\u2010 or low\u2010certainty grades of evidence and none were based on high\u2010certainty evidence.

Surgery was performed in university hospital settings. The mean age of participants was above 60, and median follow\u2010up ranged from 17.5 months to 9.6 years. Regarding the use of co\u2010interventions, one study used neoadjuvant CRT in all participants (T2 cancers); one study used short\u2010course radiotherapy in the LE group (T1\u2010T2 cancers); one study used adjuvant CRT selectively in high\u2010risk patients undergoing RR (T1\u2010T2 cancers); and the fourth study did not use any CRT (T1 cancers). We assessed the overall risk of bias as high for oncologic and morbidity outcomes across studies. All studies had at least one key domain with a high risk of bias. None of the studies reported separate outcomes for T1 versus T2 or for high\u2010risk features. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that RR may result in an improvement in disease\u2010free survival compared to LE (3 trials, 212 participants; HR 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 4.24). This would translate into a three\u2010year disease\u2010recurrence risk of 27% (95% CI 14 to 50%) versus 15% after LE and RR, respectively. Regarding sphincter function, only one study provided objective results and reported short\u2010term deterioration in stool frequency, flatulence, incontinence, abdominal pain, and embarrassment about bowel function in the RR group. At three years, the LE group had superiority in overall stool frequency, embarrassment about bowel function, and diarrhea. Local excision may have little to no effect on cancer\u2010related survival compared to RR (3 trials, 207 participants; HR 1.42, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.33; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We did not pool studies for local recurrence, but the included studies individually reported comparable local recurrence rates for LE and RR (low\u2010certainty evidence). It is unclear if the risk of major postoperative complications may be lower with LE compared with RR (risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.28; low\u2010certainty evidence; corresponding to 5.8% (95% CI 2.4% to 14.1%) risk for LE versus 11% for RR). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence shows that the risk of minor postoperative complications is probably lower after LE (risk ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.85); corresponding to an absolute risk of 14% (95% CI 8% to 26%) for LE compared to 30.1% for RR. One study reported an 11% rate of temporary stoma after LE versus 82% in the RR group. Another study reported a 46% rate of temporary or permanent stomas after RR and none after LE. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of LE compared with RR on quality of life. Only one study reported standard quality of life function, in favor of LE, with a 90% or greater probability of superiority in overall quality of life, role, social, and emotional functions, body image, and health anxiety. Other studies reported a significantly shorter postoperative period to oral intake, bowel movement, and off\u2010bed activities in the LE group. ", "conclusion": " Based on low\u2010certainty evidence, LE may decrease disease\u2010free survival in early rectal cancer. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that LE may have little to no effect on cancer\u2010related survival compared to RR for the treatment of stage I rectal cancer. Based on low\u2010certainty evidence, it is unclear if LE may have a lower major complication rate, but probably causes a large reduction in minor complication rate. Limited data based on one study suggest better sphincter function, quality of life, or genitourinary function after LE. Limitations exist with respect to the applicability of these findings. We identified only four eligible studies with a low number of total participants, subjecting the results to imprecision. Risk of bias had a serious impact on the quality of evidence. More RCTs are needed to answer our review question with greater certainty and to compare local and distant metastasis rates. Data on important patient outcomes such as sphincter function and quality of life are very limited. Results of currently ongoing trials will likely impact the results of this review. Future trials should accurately report and compare outcomes according to the stage and high\u2010risk features of rectal tumors, and evaluate quality of life, sphincter, and genitourinary outcomes. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy as an emerging co\u2010intervention for improving oncologic outcomes after LE needs to be further defined. "}

The RCTs evaluated different modes of digital health technologies with distinct purposes, combined with diverse interventions. We identified important methodologic concerns in the RCTs, including insufficient information on the randomization process, blinding of outcome assessors, balance of non\u2010protocol interventions across groups, and whether the analyses performed corrected for bias due to missing outcome data. Non\u2010reporting of results may also be a concern, especially because some planned outcome results were reported incompletely.

All studies were conducted in adults, and were carried out in Iran, Vietnam, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Pakistan, and the USA. Studies were conducted in several settings, including colleges/universities, community healthcare centers, tuberculosis hospitals, and cancer treatment centers, while two studies tested e\u2010health interventions (online web\u2010based educational intervention, text message intervention). Overall, we judged three studies to be at low risk of bias, and six studies at high risk of bias. We pooled data from five studies (1030 participants) that tested intensive face\u2010to\u2010face behavioral interventions compared with brief behavioral intervention (e.g. one behavioral counseling session), usual care (e.g. self\u2010help materials), or no intervention. In our meta\u2010analysis, we included people who used waterpipe exclusively, or with another form of tobacco. Overall, we found low\u2010certainty evidence of a benefit of behavioral support for waterpipe abstinence (RR 3.19 95% CI 2.17 to 4.69; I 2  = 41%; 5 studies, N = 1030). We downgraded the evidence because of imprecision and risk of bias. We pooled data from two studies (N = 662 participants) that tested varenicline combined with behavioral intervention compared with placebo combined with behavioral intervention. Although the point estimate favored varenicline, 95% CIs were imprecise, and incorporated the potential for no difference and lower quit rates in the varenicline groups, as well as a benefit as large as that found in cigarette smoking cessation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.24; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, N = 662; low\u2010certainty evidence). We downgraded the evidence because of imprecision. We found no clear evidence of a difference in the number of participants experiencing adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.44; I 2  = 31%; 2 studies, N = 662). The studies did not report serious adverse events.   One study tested the efficacy of seven weeks of bupropion therapy combined with behavioral intervention. There was no clear evidence of benefit for waterpipe cessation when compared with behavioral support alone (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.41; 1 study, N = 121; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or with self\u2010help (RR 1.94, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.00; 1 study, N = 86; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  Two studies tested e\u2010health interventions. One study reported higher waterpipe quit rates among participants randomized to either a tailored mobile phone or untailored mobile phone intervention compared with those randomized to no intervention (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05; 2 studies, N = 319; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Another study reported higher waterpipe abstinence rates following an intensive online educational intervention compared with a brief online educational intervention (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.21; 1 study, N = 70; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  ", "conclusion": " We found low\u2010certainty evidence that behavioral waterpipe cessation interventions can increase waterpipe quit rates among waterpipe smokers. We found insufficient evidence to assess whether varenicline or bupropion increased waterpipe abstinence; available evidence is compatible with effect sizes similar to those seen for cigarette smoking cessation.  Given e\u2010health interventions' potential reach and effectiveness for waterpipe cessation, trials with large samples and long follow\u2010up periods are needed. Future studies should use biochemical validation of abstinence to prevent the risk of detection bias. Finally, there has been limited attention given to high\u2010risk groups for waterpipe smoking, such as youth, young adults, pregnant women, and dual or poly tobacco users. These groups would benefit from targeted studies. "}

Nineteen trials included only participants with decompensated cirrhosis; in one trial, 30% had compensated cirrhosis. The included trials were conducted in Asia (15), Europe (four), and the USA (one). Not all trials provided data for our outcomes. All trials reported data allowing intention\u2010to\u2010treat analyses. The experimental intervention consisted of G\u2010CSF alone or G\u2010CSF plus any of the following: growth hormone, erythropoietin, N\u2010acetyl cysteine, infusion of CD133\u2010positive haemopoietic stem cells, or infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells. The control group consisted of no intervention in 15 trials and placebo (normal saline) in five trials. Standard medical therapy (antivirals, alcohol abstinence, nutrition, diuretics, \u03b2\u2010blockers, selective intestinal decontamination, pentoxifylline, prednisolone, and other supportive measures depending on the clinical status and requirement) was administered equally to the trial groups. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggested a decrease in mortality with G\u2010CSF, administered alone or in combination with any of the above, versus placebo (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; I 2  = 75%; 1419 participants; 20 trials). Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggested no difference in serious adverse events (G\u2010CSF alone or in combination versus placebo: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.61; I 2  = 66%; 315 participants; three trials). Eight trials, with 518 participants, reported no serious adverse events. Two trials, with 165 participants, used two components of the quality of life score for assessment, with ranges from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better quality of life, with a mean increase from baseline of the physical component summary of 20.7 (95% CI 17.4 to 24.0; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and a mean increase from baseline of the mental component summary of 27.8 (95% CI 12.3 to 43.3; very low\u2010certainty evidence). G\u2010CSF, alone or in combination, suggested a beneficial effect on the proportion of participants who developed one or more liver disease\u2010related complications (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.92; I 2  = 62%; 195 participants; four trials; very low\u2010certainty evidence). When we analysed the occurrences of single complications, there was no suggestion of a difference between G\u2010CSF, alone or in combination, versus control, in participants in need of liver transplantation (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.85; 692 participants; five trials), in the development of hepatorenal syndrome (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.30; 520 participants; six trials), in the occurrence of variceal bleeding (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.23; 614 participants; eight trials), and in the development of encephalopathy (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.01; 605 participants; seven trials) (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The same comparison suggested that G\u2010CSF reduces the development of infections (including sepsis) (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.84; 583 participants; eight trials) and does not improve liver function scores (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; 319 participants; two trials) (very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " G\u2010CSF, alone or in combination, seems to decrease mortality in people with decompensated advanced chronic liver disease of whatever aetiology and with or without acute\u2010on\u2010chronic liver failure, but the certainty of evidence is very low because of high risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The results of trials conducted in Asia and Europe were discrepant; this could not be explained by differences in participant selection, intervention, and outcome measurement. Data on serious adverse events and health\u2010related quality of life were few and inconsistently reported. The evidence is also very uncertain regarding the occurrence of one or more liver disease\u2010related complications. We lack high\u2010quality, global randomised clinical trials assessing the effect of G\u2010CSF on clinically relevant outcomes. "}

Three studies involved 3281 neonates; the remaining three did not specify the actual number of neonates included in their study. Three studies involved 279 nurses working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The number of nurses included was not specified by one study. A cluster\u2010RCT included 103 pregnant women of over 34 weeks gestation from 10 villages in a community setting (sources of data: 103 mother\u2010neonate pairs) and another community\u2010based study included 258 married pregnant women at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation (the trial reported adverse events on 258 mothers and 246 neonates). Studies examined the effectiveness of different hand hygiene practices for the incidence of suspected infection (author\u2010defined in study) within the first 28 days of life. Three studies were rated as having low risk for allocation bias,  two studies were rated as unclear risk, and one was rated as having high risk. One study was rated as having a low risk of bias for allocation concealment,  one study was rated as unclear risk, and four werw rated as having high risk. Two studies were rated as having low risk for performance bias and two were rated as having low risk for attrition bias.  One class of agent versus another class of agent: 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) compared to alcohol hand sanitiser (61% alcohol and emollients) For this comparison, no study assessed the effect of the intervention on the incidence of suspected infection within the first 28 days of life. Two percent chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) probably reduces the risk of all infection in neonates compared to 61% alcohol hand sanitiser in regard to the incidence of all bacteriologically confirmed infection within the first 28 days of life (RR 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.93; 2932 participants, 1 study; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB): 385. The adverse outcome was reported as mean self\u2010reported skin change and mean observer\u2010reported skin change. There may be little to no difference between the effects of 2% CHG on nurses\u2019 skin compared to alcohol hand sanitiser, based on very low\u2010certainty evidence for mean self\u2010reported skin change (mean difference (MD) \u20100.80, 95% CI \u20101.59 to 0.01; 119 participants, 1 study) and on mean observer reported skin change (MD \u20100.19, CI \u20100.35 to \u20100.03; 119 participants, 1 study), respectively. We identified no study that reported on all\u2010cause mortality and other outcomes for this comparison. None of the included studies assessed all\u2010cause mortality within the first seven days of life nor the duration of hospital stay. One class of agent versus two or more other classes of agent: CHG compared to plain liquid soap + hand sanitiser We identified no studies that reported on our primary and secondary outcomes for this comparison except for author\u2010defined adverse events. We are very uncertain whether plain soap plus hand sanitiser is better than CHG for nurses\u2019 skin based on very low\u2010certainty evidence (MD \u20101.87, 95% CI \u20103.74 to \u20100.00; 16 participants, 1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  One agent versus standard care: alcohol\u2010based handrub (hand sanitiser) versus usual care The evidence is very uncertain whether alcohol\u2010based handrub is better than 'usual care' in the prevention of suspected infections, as reported by mothers (RR 0.98, CI 0.69 to 1.39; 103 participants, 1 study, very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether alcohol\u2010based hand sanitiser is better than 'usual care' in reducing the occurrence of early and late neonatal mortality (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.00; 103 participants, 1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and (RR 0.29, CI 0.01 to 7.00; 103 participants, 1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence), respectively. We identified no studies that reported on other outcomes for this comparison. ", "conclusion": " We found a paucity of data that would allow us to reach meaningful conclusions pertaining to the superiority of one form of antiseptic hand hygiene agent over another for the prevention of neonatal infection. Also, the sparse available data were of moderate\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty. We are uncertain as to the superiority of one hand hygiene agent over another because this review included very few studies with very serious study limitations. "}

No study assessed the proportions of participants reporting no worse than mild pain on treatment by 14 days after start of treatment. We found five RCTs assessing oromucosal nabiximols (tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) or THC alone involving 1539 participants with moderate or severe pain despite opioid therapy. The double\u2010blind periods of the RCTs ranged between two and five weeks. Four studies with a parallel design and 1333 participants were available for meta\u2010analysis.

There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence for no difference between nabiximols or THC and placebo in the frequency of serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.07). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence that nabiximols and THC used as add\u2010on treatment for opioid\u2010refractory cancer pain did not differ from placebo in reducing mean pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.19, 95% CI \u22120.40 to 0.02).

Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low\u2010certainty evidence that synthetic THC analogues were superior to placebo (SMD \u22120.98, 95% CI \u22121.36 to \u22120.60), but not superior to low\u2010dose codeine (SMD 0.03, 95% CI \u22120.25 to 0.32; 5 single\u2010dose trials; 126 participants) in reducing moderate\u2010to\u2010severe cancer pain after cessation of previous analgesic treatment for three to four and a half hours (2 single\u2010dose trials; 66 participants). Analyses of tolerability and safety were not possible for these studies. There was low\u2010certainty evidence that CBD oil did not add value to specialist palliative care alone in the reduction of pain intensity in people with advanced cancer.

All studies excluded women with preterm or complicated pregnancies. Techniques used to initiate epidural analgesia differed between the studies: seven used combined spinal epidural, 10 used epidural, and one used dural puncture epidural (DPE). There was also variation in analgesics used. Eight studies utilised ropivacaine with fentanyl, three used ropivacaine with sufentanil, two utilised levobupivacaine with sufentanil, one used levobupivacaine with fentanyl, and four utilised bupivacaine with fentanyl. Most of the studies were assessed to have low risk of randomisation, blinding, attrition, and reporting biases, except for allocation concealment where eight studies were assessed to have uncertain risk and three with high risk. Our results showed that AMB was associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain compared to BI (risk ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 0.91; I 2  = 57%) (16 studies, 1528 participants), and lower hourly LA consumption in bupivacaine equivalents (mean difference (MD) \u20100.84 mg/h; 95% CI \u20101.29 to \u20100.38, I 2  = 87%) (16 studies, 1642 participants), both with moderate certainty. AMB was associated with an estimated reduction in breakthrough pain incidence of 29.1% (incidence 202 per 1000, 95% CI 157 to 259), and was therefore considered clinically significant. The incidence of caesarean delivery (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; I 2  = 0%) (16 studies, 1735 participants) and instrumental delivery (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; I 2  = 0%) (17 studies, 4550 participants) were not significantly, both with moderate certainty.

Due to differences in the methods and timing of outcome measurements, we did not pool data for maternal satisfaction and Apgar scores. Results reported narratively suggest AMB may be associated with increased maternal satisfaction (eight studies reported increased satisfaction and six reported no difference), and all studies showed no difference in Apgar scores. WIth the exception of epidural alone versus CSE which found significant subgroup differences in LA consumption between AMB and BI, no significant differences were detected in the remaining subgroup analyses. ", "conclusion": " Overall, AMB is associated with lower incidence of breakthrough pain, reduced LA consumption, and may improve maternal satisfaction.

The median number of participants per study was 700. In each study, between 54% and 91% (median 70%) of participants were males. Study participants had an average age of 64 years and percentage predicted FEV 1  of 51.5% (medians of study means). Included studies had a generally low risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. All but two studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, which had varying levels of involvement in study design, conduct, and data analysis. Primary outcomes The odds of having an exacerbation were similar for LAMA+LABA compared with LABA+ICS (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; I 2  = 61%; 13 studies, 20,960 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

There is little to no difference between LAMA+LABA and LAMA+ICS in the odds of having a serious adverse event.

We found one ongoing study. Participants were either stung accidentally, or were healthy volunteers exposed to stings in a laboratory setting. Type of jellyfish could not be confirmed in beach settings and was determined by investigators using participant and local information. We categorised interventions into comparison groups: hot versus cold applications; topical applications. A third comparison of parenteral administration included no relevant outcome data: a single study (39 participants) evaluated intravenous magnesium sulfate after stings from jellyfish that cause Irukandji syndrome ( Carukia) . No studies assessed a fourth comparison group of pressure immobilisation bandages.  We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to very serious risk of bias, serious and very serious imprecision, and serious inconsistency in some results.  Application of heat versus application of cold Four studies involved accidental stings treated on the beach or in hospital. Jellyfish were described as bluebottles ( Physalia ; location: Australia), and box jellyfish that do not cause Irukandji syndrome (Hawaiian box jellyfish ( Carybdea alata ) and major box jellyfish ( Chironex fleckeri , location: Australia)). Treatments were applied with hot packs or hot water (showers, baths, buckets, or hoses), or ice packs or cold packs.  The evidence for all outcomes was of very low certainty, thus we are unsure whether heat compared to cold leads to at least a clinically significant reduction in pain within six hours of stings from  Physalia  (risk ratio (RR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.56; 2 studies, 142 participants) or  Carybdea alata  and  Chironex fleckeri  (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.94; 2 studies, 71 participants). We are unsure whether there is a difference in adverse events due to treatment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.19; 2 studies, 142 participants); these were minor adverse events reported for  Physalia  stings. We are also unsure whether either treatment leads to a clinically significant reduction in pain in the first hour ( Physalia : RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.15; 1 study, 88 participants;  Carybdea alata  and  Chironex fleckeri:  RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.89; 1 study, 42 participants) or cessation of pain at the end of treatment ( Physalia : RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.27; 1 study, 54 participants;  Carybdea alata  and  Chironex fleckeri:  RR 3.54, 95% CI 0.82 to 15.31; 1 study, 29 participants). Evidence for retreatment with the same intervention was only available for  Physalia , with similar uncertain findings (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.90; 1 study, 96 participants), as was the case for retreatment with the alternative hot or cold application after  Physalia  (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.82; 1 study, 54 participants) and  Chironex fleckeri  stings (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.02 to 11.17; 1 study, 42 participants). Evidence for dermatological signs (itchiness or rash) was available only at 24 hours for  Physalia  stings (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.65; 2 studies, 98 participants).  Topical applications One study (62 participants) included accidental stings from Hawaiian box jellyfish ( Carybdea alata)  treated on the beach with fresh water, seawater, Sting Aid (a commercial product), or Adolph's (papain) meat tenderiser. In another study, healthy volunteers (97 participants) were stung with an Indonesian sea nettle ( Chrysaora chinensis  from Malaysia) in a laboratory setting and treated with isopropyl alcohol, ammonia, heated water, acetic acid, or sodium bicarbonate. Two other eligible studies ( Carybdea alata  and  Physalia  stings) did not measure the outcomes of this review.  The evidence for all outcomes was of very low certainty, thus we could not be certain whether or not topical applications provided at least a clinically significant reduction in pain (1 study, 62 participants with  Carybdea alata  stings, reported only as cessation of pain). For adverse events due to treatment, one study ( Chrysaora chinensis  stings) withdrew ammonia as a treatment following a first\u2010degree burn in one participant. No studies evaluated clinically significant reduction in pain, retreatment with the same or the alternative treatment, or dermatological signs. ", "conclusion": " Few studies contributed data to this review, and those that did contribute varied in types of treatment, settings, and range of jellyfish species. We are unsure of the effectiveness of any of the treatments evaluated in this review given the very low certainty of all the evidence. This updated review includes two new studies (with 139 additional participants). The findings are consistent with the previous review.  "}

One study evaluated MI combined with physical practice of walking versus physical practice of walking alone. One study compared two different gait training protocols. The two studies recruited people who already used prosthesis; therefore, we could not assess prosthesis use. The studies did not report mortality, QoL or phantom limb pain.

Most of the participants were female (range: 52% to 100%), and were mainly white. Limited information was provided on socioeconomic status of participants. Seventeen studies were conducted in North America, with the remaining studies conducted in the UK (N = 2), Iran (N = 1), Australia (N = 1) and Democratic Republic of Congo (N = 1). CBT was explored in 14 studies and CCT in eight studies; psychodynamic therapy, family therapy and EMDR were each explored in two studies. Management as usual (MAU) was the comparator in three studies and a waiting list was the comparator in five studies. For all outcomes, comparisons were informed by low numbers of studies (one to three per comparison), sample sizes were small (median = 52, range 11 to 229) and networks were poorly connected. Our estimates were all imprecise and uncertain. Primary outcomes \u2028At post\u2010treatment, network meta\u2010analysis (NMA) was possible for measures of psychological distress and behaviour, but not for social functioning. Relative to MAU, there was very low certainty evidence that CCT involving parent and child reduced PTSD (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.87, 95% confidence intervals (CI) \u20101.64 to \u20100.10), and CBT with only the child reduced PTSD symptoms (SMD \u20100.96, 95% CI \u20101.72 to \u20100.20). There was no clear evidence of an effect of any therapy relative to MAU for other primary outcomes or at any other time point. Secondary outcomes \u2028Compared to MAU, there was very low certainty evidence that, at post\u2010treatment, CBT delivered to the child and the carer might reduce parents' emotional reactions (SMD \u20106.95, 95% CI \u201010.11 to \u20103.80), and that CCT might reduce parents' stress. However, there is high uncertainty in these effect estimates and both comparisons were informed only by one study. There was no evidence that the other therapies improved any other secondary outcome. We attributed very low levels of confidence for all NMA and pairwise estimates for the following reasons. Reporting limitations resulted in judgements of 'unclear' to 'high' risk of bias in relation to selection, detection, performance, attrition and reporting bias; the effect estimates we derived were imprecise, and small or close to no change; our networks were underpowered due to the low number of studies informing them; and whilst studies were broadly comparable with regard to settings, the use of a manual, the training of the therapists, the duration of treatment and number of sessions offered, there was considerable variability in the age of participants and the format in which the interventions were delivered (individual or group). ", "conclusion": " There was weak evidence that both CCT (delivered to child and carer) and CBT (delivered to the child) might reduce PTSD symptoms at post\u2010treatment. However, the effect estimates are uncertain and imprecise. For the remaining outcomes examined, none of the estimates suggested that any of the interventions reduced symptoms compared to management as usual. Weaknesses in the evidence base include the dearth of evidence from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. Further, not all interventions have been evaluated to the same extent, and there is little evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions for male participants or those from different ethnicities. In 18 studies, the age ranges of participants ranged from 4 to 16 years old or 5 to 17 years old. This may have influenced the way in which the interventions were delivered, received, and consequently influenced outcomes. Many of the included studies evaluated interventions that were developed by members of the research team. In others, developers were involved in monitoring the delivery of the treatment. It remains the case that evaluations conducted by independent research teams are needed to reduce the potential for investigator bias. Studies addressing these gaps would help to establish the relative effectiveness of interventions currently used with this vulnerable population. "}

Eligible multi\u2010domain prognostic models involved two or more of the modifiable dementia predictors identified in a 2020 Lancet Commission report and a 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) report (less education, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, hypertension, excessive alcohol intake, obesity, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes mellitus, air pollution, poor diet, and cognitive inactivity). Our secondary objectives were to summarise the prognostic models, to appraise their predictive accuracy (discrimination and calibration) as reported in the development and validation studies, and to identify the implications of using dementia prognostic models for the management of people at a higher risk for future dementia. \n\nMain results:\n We identified 20 eligible studies; eight were development studies and 12 were validation studies. There were 14 unique prognostic models: seven models with validation studies and seven models with development\u2010only studies. The models included a median of nine predictors (range 6 to 34); the median number of modifiable predictors was five (range 2 to 11). The most common modifiable predictors in externally validated models were diabetes, hypertension, smoking, physical activity, and obesity. In development\u2010only models, the most common modifiable predictors were obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. No models included hearing loss or air pollution as predictors. Nineteen studies had a high risk of bias according to the PROBAST assessment, mainly because of inappropriate analysis methods, particularly lack of reported calibration measures. Applicability concerns were low for 12 studies, as their population, predictors, and outcomes were consistent with those of interest for this review. Applicability concerns were high for nine studies, as they lacked baseline cognitive screening or excluded an age group within the range of 45 to 65 years. Only one model, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing, and Dementia (CAIDE), had been externally validated in multiple studies, allowing for meta\u2010analysis. The CAIDE model included eight predictors (four modifiable predictors): age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, physical activity and APOE\u01904 status. Overall, our confidence in the prediction accuracy of CAIDE was very low; our main reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence were high risk of bias across all the studies, high concern of applicability, non\u2010overlapping confidence intervals (CIs), and a high degree of heterogeneity.

We also assessed cost\u2010effectiveness. \n\nMain results:\n We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short follow\u2010up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral \u2013 ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled \u2013 tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV \u2013 ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for  P aeruginosa  at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants).

We found moderate\u2010certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported age\u2010adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and culture\u2010based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and culture\u2010based TNS therapy.

Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; low\u2010certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating  P aeruginosa  after a three\u2010month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) \u20107.50, 95% CI \u201024.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of  P aeruginosa  at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95 % CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence).

Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of  P aeruginosa . One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used.

The data available from one trial provided only very low\u2010certainty evidence about the effect of prebiotics on measures of neurodevelopmental impairment (Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) Mental Development Index score < 85: RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.90; very low\u2010certainty evidence; BSID Psychomotor Development Index score < 85: RR 0.24, 95% 0.03 to 2.00; very low\u2010certainty evidence; cerebral palsy: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.35; very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " The available trial data provide low\u2010certainty evidence about the effects of prebiotics on the risk of NEC, all\u2010cause mortality before discharge, and invasive infection, and very low\u2010certainty evidence about the effect on neurodevelopmental impairment for very preterm or VLBW infants. Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited; the true effects may be substantially different. Large, high\u2010quality trials are needed to provide evidence of sufficient validity to inform policy and practice decisions. "}

We identified a further 17 registered RCTs evaluating IL\u20106 blocking agents without results available as of 7 June 2022.  The mean age range varied from 56 to 75 years; 66.2% (8051/12,160) of enrolled participants were men. One\u2010third (11/32) of included trials were placebo\u2010controlled. Twenty\u2010two were published in peer\u2010reviewed journals, three were reported as preprints, two trials had results posted only on registries, and results from five trials were retrieved from another meta\u2010analysis. Eight were funded by pharmaceutical companies.  Twenty\u2010six included studies were multicenter trials; four were multinational and 22 took place in single countries. Recruitment of participants occurred between February 2020 and June 2021, with a mean enrollment duration of 21 weeks (range 1 to 54 weeks). Nineteen trials (60%) had a follow\u2010up of 60 days or more. Disease severity ranged from mild to critical disease. The proportion of participants who were intubated at study inclusion also varied from 5% to 95%. Only six trials reported vaccination status; there were no vaccinated participants included in these trials, and 17 trials were conducted before vaccination was rolled out. We assessed a total of six treatments, each compared to placebo or standard care. Twenty trials assessed tocilizumab, nine assessed sarilumab, and two assessed clazakizumab. Only one trial was included for each of the other IL\u20106 blocking agents (siltuximab, olokizumab, and levilimab). Two trials assessed more than one treatment. Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab and sarilumab compared to standard care or placebo for treating COVID\u201019 At day (D) 28, tocilizumab and sarilumab probably result in little or no increase in clinical improvement (tocilizumab: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.11; 15 RCTs, 6116 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; sarilumab: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05; 7 RCTs, 2425 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). For clinical improvement at \u2265 D60, the certainty of evidence is very low for both tocilizumab (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.48; 1 RCT, 97 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and sarilumab (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.63; 2 RCTs, 239 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The effect of tocilizumab on the proportion of participants with a WHO Clinical Progression Score (WHO\u2010CPS) of level 7 or above remains uncertain at D28 (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.12; 13 RCTs, 2117 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and that for sarilumab very uncertain (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.33; 5 RCTs, 886 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Tocilizumab reduces all cause\u2010mortality at D28 compared to standard care/placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; 18 RCTs, 7428 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence about the effect of sarilumab on this outcome is very uncertain (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; 9 RCTs, 3305 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain for all cause\u2010mortality at \u2265 D60 for tocilizumab (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.04; 9 RCTs, 2775 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and very uncertain for sarilumab (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; 6 RCTs, 3379 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Tocilizumab probably results in little to no difference in the risk of adverse events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 9 RCTs, 1811 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence about adverse events for sarilumab is uncertain (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.28; 4 RCT, 860 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  The evidence about serious adverse events is very uncertain for tocilizumab (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; 16 RCTs; 2974 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and uncertain for sarilumab (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.21; 6 RCTs; 2936 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Efficacy and safety of clazakizumab, olokizumab, siltuximab and levilimab compared to standard care or placebo for treating COVID\u201019 The evidence about the effects of clazakizumab, olokizumab, siltuximab, and levilimab comes from only one or two studies for each blocking agent, and is uncertain or very uncertain. ", "conclusion": " In hospitalized people with COVID\u201019, results show a beneficial effect of tocilizumab on all\u2010cause mortality in the short term and probably little or no difference in the risk of adverse events compared to standard care alone or placebo. Nevertheless, both tocilizumab and sarilumab probably result in little or no increase in clinical improvement at D28. Evidence for an effect of sarilumab and the other IL\u20106 blocking agents on critical outcomes is uncertain or very uncertain. Most of the trials included in our review were done before the waves of different variants of concern and before vaccination was rolled out on a large scale. An additional 17 RCTs of IL\u20106 blocking agents are currently registered with no results yet reported. The number of pending studies and the number of participants planned is low. Consequently, we will not publish further updates of this review. "}

One study was conducted in Iran, the second in the USA, although exact location in the USA is unclear. Galantamine plus risperidone versus placebo plus risperidone One study compared the effects of galantamine plus risperidone to placebo plus risperidone (40 participants, aged 4 years to 12 years). Primary and secondary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (score 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low\u2010certainty evidence showed there was little to no difference between the two groups postintervention for social communication (mean difference (MD) \u20102.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20105.88 to 0.38), and restricted and repetitive behaviour (MD \u20100.55, 95% CI \u20103.47 to 2.37). Overall autism features were not assessed. Adverse events may be higher in the galantamine plus risperidone group (75%) compared with the placebo plus risperidone group (35%): odds ratio 5.57, 95% CI 1.42 to 21.86, low\u2010certainty evidence. No serious adverse events were reported. Low\u2010certainty evidence showed a small difference in irritability (MD \u20103.50, 95% CI \u20106.39 to \u20100.61), with the galantamine plus risperidone group showing a greater decline on the irritability subscale than the placebo group postintervention. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in hyperactivity postintervention (MD \u20105.20, 95% CI \u201010.51 to 0.11). General health and function were not assessed. Donepezil versus placebo One study compared donepezil to placebo (34 participants aged 8 years to 17 years). Primary outcomes of interest were measured postintervention, using subscales of the Modified Version of The Real Life Rating Scale (scored 0 to 3; higher scores = greater impairment). Very low\u2010certainty evidence showed no evidence of group differences immediately postintervention in overall autism features (MD 0.07, 95% CI \u20100.19 to 0.33), or in the autism symptom domains of social communication (MD \u20100.02, 95% CI \u20100.34 to 0.30), and restricted and repetitive behaviours (MD 0.04, 95% CI \u20100.27 to 0.35). Significant adverse events leading to study withdrawal in at least one participant was implied in the data analysis section, but not explicitly reported. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of donepezil, compared to placebo, on the secondary outcomes of interest, including irritability (MD 1.08, 95% CI \u20100.41 to 2.57), hyperactivity (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.70), and general health and function (MD 0.03, 95% CI \u20100.48 to 0.54) postintervention. Across all analyses within this comparison, we judged the evidence to be very low\u2010certainty due to high risk of bias, and very serious imprecision (results based on one small study with wide confidence intervals). The study narratively reported adverse events for the study as a whole, rather than by treatment group. ", "conclusion": " Evidence about the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors as a medication to improve outcomes for autistic adults is lacking, and for autistic children is very uncertain. There is a need for more evidence of improvement in outcomes of relevance to clinical care, autistic people, and their families. There are a number of ongoing studies involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and future updates of this review may add to the current evidence. "}

The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (11 from China, three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Mexico and the remaining studies from South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Pakistan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were the well\u2010recognised complications of proliferative retinopathy: non\u2010clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 1914 eyes.  We identified methodological issues in all of the included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators, and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation. Participants receiving intravitreal anti\u2010VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better BCVA at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone (mean difference (MD) \u20100.25 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.39 to \u20100.11; 13 studies, 699 eyes; low\u2010certainty evidence). Pre\u2010 or intraoperative anti\u2010VEGF reduced the incidence of early POVCH (12% versus 31%, risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58; 14 studies, 1038 eyes; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Perioperative anti\u2010VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late POVCH (10% versus 23%, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74; 11 studies, 579 eyes; high\u2010certainty evidence). The need for revision surgery for POVCH occurred less frequently in the anti\u2010VEGF group compared with control, but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (4% versus 13%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; 4 studies 207 eyes; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Similar imprecisely measured effects were seen for revision surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5% versus 11%, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.66; 4 studies, 145 eyes; low\u2010certainty evidence).  Anti\u2010VEGFs reduce the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks (12% versus 31%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59; 12 studies, 915 eyes; high\u2010certainty evidence) and the need for silicone oil (19% versus 41%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; 10 studies, 591 eyes; very low\u2010certainty evidence). No data were available on quality of life outcomes or the proportion of participants with visual acuity of counting fingers or worse. ", "conclusion": " The perioperative use of anti\u2010VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes. It also reduces the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks. The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade. The reported complications from its use appear to be low. Agreement on variables included and outcome standardisation is required in trials studying vitrectomy for PDR. "}

Secondary objectives To assess the association between the number of doses of PEG\u2010asparaginase and asparaginase\u2010associated toxicities (e.g. hypersensitivity, thromboembolism, pancreatitis and osteonecrosis). To undertake a network meta\u2010analysis at dose\u2010level in order to generate rankings of the number of doses of PEG\u2010asparaginase used in the treatment for ALL, according to their benefits (survival and relapse) and harms (toxicity). \n\nMain results:\n We included three RCTs in the review, and identified an additional four ongoing studies. We judged outcomes of two RCTs to be at low risk of bias in all the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2) domains. We rated the remaining study as having some concerns regarding bias. Due to concerns about imprecision, we rated all outcomes as having low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence.  One study compared intermittent PEG\u2010asparaginase treatment (eight doses of PEG\u2010asparaginase, 1000 IU/m 2 , intramuscular (IM) administration) versus continuous PEG\u2010asparaginase treatment (15 doses of PEG\u2010asparaginase, 1000 IU/m 2 , IM) in 625 participants with non\u2010high risk ALL aged 1.0 to 17.9 years. We found that treatment with eight doses probably results in little to no difference in event\u2010free survival compared to treatment with 15 doses (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.06; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

We found that, compared to treatment with two doses, treatment with six doses probably results in little to no difference in overall survival (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and event\u2010free survival (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.04; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and may result in either no difference or a slight increase in osteonecrosis (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.00; low\u2010certainty evidence). Furthermore, we found that treatment with six doses probably increases hypersensitivity (RR 12.05, 95% CI 5.27 to 27.58; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), pancreatitis (RR 4.84, 95% CI 2.15 to 10.85; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and asparaginase\u2010associated toxicity (RR 4.49, 95% CI 3.05 to 6.59; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) compared to treatment with two doses. One trial compared calaspargase (11 doses, 2500 IU/m 2 , intravenous (IV)) versus PEG\u2010asparaginase (16 doses, 2500 IU/m 2 , IV) in 239 participants aged one to 21 years with standard\u2010 and high\u2010risk ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma.

Of the included studies, 66% involved people living with type 2 diabetes only. Participants were 50% female and the median age of participants was 58.4 years. The mean duration of follow\u2010up was 12.5 months. HbA1c was the commonest reported outcome; screening outcomes and outcomes related to cardiovascular medications, smoking and harms were reported infrequently. The most frequently evaluated QI strategies across all study arms were PE, PSM and CM, while the least frequently evaluated QI strategies included AF, FI and CQI. Our confidence in the evidence is limited due to a lack of information on how studies were conducted.  Four QI strategies (CM, TC, PE, PSM) were consistently identified as 'Top' across the majority of outcomes. All QI strategies were ranked as 'Top' for at least one key outcome. The majority of effects of individual QI strategies were modest, but when used in combination could result in meaningful population\u2010level improvements across the majority of outcomes. The median number of QI strategies in multicomponent QI programmes was three.  Combinations of the three most effective QI strategies were estimated to lead to the below effects:  \u2010 PR + PSM + CE: decrease in HbA1c by 0.41% (credibility interval (CrI) \u20100.61 to \u20100.22) when baseline HbA1c < 8.3%; \u2010 CM + PE + EPR: decrease in HbA1c by 0.62% (CrI \u20100.84 to \u20100.39) when baseline HbA1c > 8.3%;  \u2010 PE + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 2.14 mmHg (CrI \u20103.80 to \u20100.52) when baseline SBP < 136 mmHg; \u2010 CM + TC + PSM: reduction in SBP by 4.39 mmHg (CrI \u20106.20 to \u20102.56) when baseline SBP > 136 mmHg;  \u2010 TC + PE + CM: LDL\u2010C lowering of 5.73 mg/dL (CrI \u20107.93 to \u20103.61) when baseline LDL < 107 mg/dL; \u2010 TC + CM + CR: LDL\u2010C lowering by 5.52 mg/dL (CrI \u20109.24 to \u20101.89) when baseline LDL > 107 mg/dL.

There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with adverse events in the NPWT group and the dressing group, but the evidence for this outcome was also assessed as very low certainty (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.44, very low\u2010certainty evidence). Changes in ulcer size, pressure ulcer severity, cost, and pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) sores were also reported, but we were unable to draw conclusions due to the low certainly of the evidence. One study compared NPWT with a series of gel treatments, but this study provided no usable data. Another study compared NPWT with 'moist wound healing',  which did not report primary outcome data. Changes in ulcer size and cost were reported in this study, but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty; One study compared NPWT combined with internet\u2010plus home care with standard care, but no primary outcome data were reported. Changes in ulcer size, pain, and dressing change times were reported, but we also assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included studies reported time to complete healing, health\u2010related quality of life, wound infection, or wound recurrence. ", "conclusion": "  The efficacy, safety, and acceptability of NPWT in treating pressure ulcers compared to usual care are uncertain due to the lack of key data on complete wound healing, adverse events, time to complete healing, and cost\u2010effectiveness.  Compared with usual care, using NPWT may speed up the reduction of pressure ulcer size and severity of pressure ulcer, reduce pain, and dressing change times. Still, trials were small, poorly described, had short follow\u2010up times, and with a high risk of bias; any conclusions drawn from the current evidence should be interpreted with considerable caution. In the future, high\u2010quality research with large sample sizes and low risk of bias is still needed to further verify the efficacy, safety, and cost\u2010effectiveness of NPWT in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Future researchers need to recognise the importance of complete and accurate reporting of clinically important outcomes such as the complete healing rate, healing time, and adverse events. "}

Most studies recruited adults from the community or from smoking cessation clinics; four studies focused on adolescents (with participants between 12 and 21 years old). We judged 34 studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not change clinical interpretation of the results.  There was high\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion increased smoking cessation rates when compared to placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.72; I 2  = 16%; 50 studies, 18,577 participants). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence that a combination of bupropion and varenicline may have resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I 2  = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence to establish whether a combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; I 2  = 43%; 15 studies, 4117 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence that participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs than those taking placebo or no pharmacological treatment. However, results were imprecise and the CI also encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I 2  = 0%; 23 studies, 10,958 participants). Results were also imprecise when comparing SAEs between people randomised to a combination of bupropion and NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.89; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 657 participants) and randomised to bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.42; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 1268 participants). In both cases, we judged evidence to be of low certainty. There was high\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to AEs than placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I 2  = 2%; 25 studies, 12,346 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence that bupropion combined with NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 737 participants) or bupropion combined with varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 1230 participants) had an impact on the number of dropouts due to treatment. In both cases, imprecision was substantial (we judged the evidence to be of low certainty for both comparisons). Bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80; I 2  = 0%; 9 studies, 7564 participants), and to combination NRT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies; 720 participants). However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and single\u2010form NRT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I 2  = 0%; 10 studies, 7613 participants). We also found evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I 2  = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), and some evidence that bupropion resulted in superior quit rates to nortriptyline (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants), although this result was subject to imprecision. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression. ", "conclusion": " There is high\u2010certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long\u2010term smoking cessation. However, bupropion may increase SAEs (moderate\u2010certainty evidence when compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment). There is high\u2010certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with people receiving placebo or no pharmacological treatment. Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo, although bupropion may be more effective. Evidence also suggests that bupropion may be as successful as single\u2010form NRT in helping people to quit smoking, but less effective than combination NRT and varenicline. In most cases, a paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding harms and tolerability. Further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over other licensed smoking cessation treatments; namely, NRT and varenicline. However, it is important that future studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation measure and report on harms and tolerability. "}

The studies evaluated: removable versus fixed retainers (8 studies); different types of fixed retainers (22 studies) or bonding materials (3 studies); and different types of removable retainers (16 studies). Four studies evaluated more than one comparison. We judged 28 studies to have high risk of bias, 11 to have low risk, and eight studies as unclear.  We focused on 12\u2010month follow\u2010up.  The evidence is low or very low certainty. Most comparisons and outcomes were evaluated in only one study at high risk of bias, and most studies measured outcomes after less than a year. Removable versus fixed retainers Removable (part\u2010time) versus fixed   One study reported that participants wearing clear plastic retainers part\u2010time in the lower arch had more relapse than participants with multistrand fixed retainers, but the amount was not clinically significant (Little's Irregularity Index (LII) MD 0.92 mm, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.61; 56 participants).

To determine if use of hormonal contraception increases other markers of COVID\u201019 severity including hospitalization in the intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress syndrome, intubation, and mortality. A secondary objective is to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. \n\nMain results:\n We included three comparative NRSIs with 314,704 participants total and two case series describing 13 patients. The three NRSIs had serious to critical risk of bias in several domains and low study quality. Only one NRSI ascertained current use of contraceptives based on patient report; the other two used diagnostic codes within medical records to assess hormonal contraception use, but did not confirm current use nor indication for use. None of the NRSIs included thromboembolism as an outcome. Studies were not similar enough in terms of their outcomes, interventions, and study populations to combine with meta\u2010analyses. We therefore narratively synthesized all included studies. Based on results from one NRSI, there may be little to no effect of combined hormonal contraception use on odds of mortality for COVID\u201019 positive patients (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; 1 study, 18,892 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two NRSIs examined hospitalization rates for hormonal contraception users versus non\u2010users. Based on results from one NRSI, the odds of hospitalization for COVID\u201019 positive combined hormonal contraception users may be slightly decreased compared with non\u2010users for patients with BMI under 35 kg/m 2  (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97; 1 study, 295,689 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). According to results of the other NRSI assessing use of any type of hormonal contraception, there may be little to no effect on hospitalization rates for COVID\u201019 positive individuals (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.44; 1 study, 123 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We included two case series because no comparative studies directly assessed thromboembolism as an outcome. In a case series of six pediatric COVID\u201019 positive patients with pulmonary embolism, one (older than 15 years of age) was using combined hormonal contraception. In a second case series of seven COVID\u201019 positive patients with cerebral venous thrombosis, one was using oral contraceptives. One comparative study and one case series reported on intubation rates, but the evidence for both is very uncertain. In the comparative study of 123 COVID\u201019 positive patients (N = 44 using hormonal contraception and N = 79 not using hormonal contraception), no patients in either group required intubation. In the case series of seven individuals with cerebral venous thromboembolism, one oral contraceptive user and one non\u2010user required intubation. ", "conclusion": " There are no comparative studies assessing risk of thromboembolism in COVID\u201019 patients who use hormonal contraception, which was the primary objective of this review. Very little evidence exists examining the risk of increased COVID\u201019 disease severity for combined hormonal contraception users compared to non\u2010users of hormonal contraception, and the evidence that does exist is of very low certainty. The odds of hospitalization for COVID\u201019 positive users of combined hormonal contraceptives may be slightly decreased compared with those of hormonal contraceptive non\u2010users, but the evidence is very uncertain as this is based on one study restricted to patients with BMI under 35 kg/m 2 . There may be little to no effect of combined hormonal contraception use on odds of intubation or mortality among COVID\u201019 positive patients, and little to no effect of using any type of hormonal contraception on odds of hospitalization and intubation for COVID\u201019 patients. We noted no large effect for risk of increased COVID\u201019 disease severity among hormonal contraception users. We specifically noted gaps in pertinent data collection regarding hormonal contraception use such as formulation, hormone doses, and duration or timing of contraceptive use. Differing estrogens may have different thrombogenic potential given differing potency, so it would be important to know if a formulation contained, for example, ethinyl estradiol versus estradiol valerate. Additionally, we downgraded several studies for risk of bias because information on the timing of contraceptive use relative to COVID\u201019 infection and method adherence were not ascertained. No studies reported indication for hormonal contraceptive use, which is important as individuals who use hormonal management for medical conditions like heavy menstrual bleeding might have different risk profiles compared to individuals using hormones for contraception. Future studies should focus on including pertinent confounders like age, obesity, history of prior venous thromboembolism, risk factors for venous thromboembolism, and recent pregnancy. "}

This review update includes 89 new studies, bringing the total number of studies in the current review to 117 with a total of 11,119 participants randomised.  The number of participants per study arm was \u2265 50 in 32 studies. The most important risk of bias was the lack of blinding of participants.  Focus on the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress\u2010reduction intervention Fifty\u2010two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is on the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.52 to \u20100.23; 41 RCTs; 3645 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD \u20100.43, 95% CI \u20100.71 to \u20100.14; 19 RCTs; 1851 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The SMD of the short\u2010term result translates back to 4.6 points fewer on the MBI\u2010emotional exhaustion scale (MBI\u2010EE, a scale from 0 to 54). The evidence is very uncertain (one RCT; 68 participants, very low\u2010certainty evidence) about the long\u2010term effect on stress symptoms of focusing one's attention on the experience of stress. Focus away from the experience of stress versus no intervention/wait list/placebo/no stress\u2010reduction intervention  Forty\u2010two studies studied an intervention in which one's focus is away from the experience of stress. Overall, such interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms in the short term (SMD \u20100.55, 95 CI \u20100.70 to \u20100.40; 35 RCTs; 2366 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and medium term (SMD \u20100.41 95% CI \u20100.79 to \u20100.03; 6 RCTs; 427 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The SMD on the short term translates back to 6.8 fewer points on the MBI\u2010EE. No studies reported the long\u2010term effect. Focus on work\u2010related, individual\u2010level factors versus no intervention/no stress\u2010reduction intervention Seven studies studied an intervention in which the focus is on altering work\u2010related factors. The evidence is very uncertain about the short\u2010term effects (no pooled effect estimate; three RCTs; 87 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and medium\u2010term effects and long\u2010term effects (no pooled effect estimate; two RCTs; 152 participants, and one RCT; 161 participants, very low\u2010certainty evidence) of this type of stress management intervention.  A combination of individual\u2010level interventions versus no intervention/wait list/no stress\u2010reduction intervention Seventeen studies studied a combination of interventions. In the short\u2010term, this type of intervention may result in a reduction in stress symptoms (SMD \u20100.67 95%, CI \u20100.95 to \u20100.39; 15 RCTs; 1003 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The SMD translates back to 8.2 fewer points on the MBI\u2010EE. On the medium term, a combination of individual\u2010level interventions may result in a reduction in stress symptoms, but the evidence does not exclude no effect (SMD \u20100.48, 95% CI \u20100.95 to 0.00; 6 RCTs; 574 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the long term effects of a combination of interventions on stress symptoms (one RCT, 88 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Focus on stress versus other intervention type  Three studies compared focusing on stress versus focusing away from stress and one study a combination of interventions versus focusing on stress. The evidence is very uncertain about which type of intervention is better or if their effect is similar. ", "conclusion": " Our review shows that there may be an effect on stress reduction in healthcare workers from individual\u2010level stress interventions, whether they focus one's attention on or away from the experience of stress. This effect may last up to a year after the end of the intervention. A combination of interventions may be beneficial as well, at least in the short term. Long\u2010term effects of individual\u2010level stress management interventions remain unknown. The same applies for interventions on (individual\u2010level) work\u2010related risk factors. The bias assessment of the studies in this review showed the need for methodologically better\u2010designed and executed studies, as nearly all studies suffered from poor reporting of the randomisation procedures, lack of blinding of participants and lack of trial registration. Better\u2010designed trials with larger sample sizes are required to increase the certainty of the evidence. Last, there is a need for more studies on interventions which focus on work\u2010related risk factors.  "}

Three studies were included in the previous version of the review. For this update, we included eight studies, which provided data on 759 intubation attempts in neonates. We included neonates of either sex, who were undergoing endotracheal intubation in international hospitals. Different videolaryngoscopy devices (including C\u2010MAC, Airtraq, and Glidescope) were used in the studies. For the primary outcomes; videolaryngoscopy may not reduce the time required for successful intubation when compared with direct laryngoscopy (mean difference [MD] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u20100.19 to 1.67; 5 studies; 505 intubations; low\u2010certainty evidence).

Included trials were conducted in tertiary care centres and recruited patients during periods ranging from 17 months to 45 months. A total of 130 participants enrolled in a preoperative four\u2010week trimodal prehabilitation programme consisting of exercise, nutritional intervention, and anxiety reduction techniques. Outcomes of these participants were compared to those of 120 participants who started an identical but postoperative programme.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD014682.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of antidepressants for adults with chronic pain (except headache). \n\nMain results:\n This review and NMA included 176 studies with a total of 28,664 participants. The majority of studies were placebo\u2010controlled (83), and parallel\u2212armed (141). The most common pain conditions examined were fibromyalgia (59 studies); neuropathic pain (49 studies) and musculoskeletal pain (40 studies). The average length of RCTs was 10 weeks. Seven studies provided no useable data and were omitted from the NMA. The majority of studies measured short\u2010term outcomes only and excluded people with low mood and other mental health conditions. Across efficacy outcomes, duloxetine was consistently the highest\u2010ranked antidepressant with moderate\u2010 to high\u2010certainty evidence. In duloxetine studies, standard dose was equally efficacious as high dose for the majority of outcomes. Milnacipran was often ranked as the next most efficacious antidepressant, although the certainty of evidence was lower than that of duloxetine. There was insufficient evidence to draw robust conclusions for the efficacy and safety of any other antidepressant for chronic pain.  Primary efficacy outcomes Duloxetine standard dose (60 mg) showed a small to moderate effect for substantial pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.69 to 2.17; 16 studies, 4490 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and continuous pain intensity (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.31, 95% CI \u22120.39 to \u22120.24; 18 studies, 4959 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). For pain intensity, milnacipran standard dose (100 mg) also showed a small effect (SMD \u22120.22, 95% CI \u22120.39 to 0.06; 4 studies, 1866 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Mirtazapine (30 mg) had a moderate effect on mood (SMD \u22120.5, 95% CI \u22120.78 to \u22120.22; 1 study, 406 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), while duloxetine showed a small effect (SMD \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.22 to \u22120.1; 26 studies, 7952 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); however it is important to note that most studies excluded participants with mental health conditions, and so average anxiety and depression scores tended to be in the 'normal' or 'subclinical' ranges at baseline already. Secondary efficacy outcomes Across all secondary efficacy outcomes (moderate pain relief, physical function, sleep, quality of life, and PGIC), duloxetine and milnacipran were the highest\u2010ranked antidepressants with moderate\u2010certainty evidence, although effects were small. For both duloxetine and milnacipran, standard doses were as efficacious as high doses. Safety There was very low\u2010certainty evidence for all safety outcomes (adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawal) across all antidepressants. We cannot draw any reliable conclusions from the NMAs for these outcomes. ", "conclusion": " Our review and NMAs show that despite studies investigating 25 different antidepressants, the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose. There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, although further high\u2010quality research is needed to be confident in these conclusions. Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty. As RCTs excluded people with low mood, we were unable to establish the effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain and depression. There is currently no reliable evidence for the long\u2010term efficacy of any antidepressant, and no reliable evidence for the safety of antidepressants for chronic pain at any time point.  "}

Furthermore, we wanted to investigate and report the personal stress seen in healthcare professionals and if possible describe their attitudes toward the FPDR initiative. \n\nMain results:\n The electronic searches yielded a total of 7292 records after deduplication.

In the trial that accounted for most of the included participants (570/595), the frequency of PTSD\u2010related symptoms was significantly higher in the control group after 3 and 12 months, and in the per\u2010protocol analyses a significant statistical difference was found in favor of FPDR when looking at PTSD, anxiety and depression, and complicated grief after 1 year.  One of the included studies also measured duration of patient resuscitation and personal stress in healthcare professionals during FPDR and found no difference between groups. Both studies had high risk of bias, and the evidence for all outcomes except one was assessed as very low certainty. ", "conclusion": " There was insufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusions on the effects of FPDR on relatives' psychological outcomes.   Sufficiently powered and well\u2010designed randomized controlled trials may change the conclusions of the review in future. "}

Most studies used adequate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel is challenging with a manual therapy intervention; however, the use of objective outcomes meant that the lack of blinding was unlikely to affect the results. Most studies reported little or no loss to follow\u2010up, and few trial protocols were available. One study that was terminated early was judged as high risk for other sources of bias. Meta\u2010analysis showed that compared to usual care alone, the combination of moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the chance of non\u2010cephalic presentation at birth (7 trials, 1152 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 0.99, I 2  = 38%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of moxibustion plus usual care on the need for ECV (4 trials, 692 women; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.21, I 2  = 78%; low\u2010certainty evidence) because the CIs included both appreciable benefit and moderate harm. Adding moxibustion to usual care probably has little to no effect on the chance of caesarean section (6 trials, 1030 women; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05, I 2  = 0%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of moxibustion plus usual care on the the chance of premature rupture of membranes (3 trials, 402 women; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.17 to 10.21, I 2  = 59%; low\u2010certainty evidence) because there were very few data. Moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the use of oxytocin (1 trial, 260 women; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the chance of cord blood pH less than 7.1 (1 trial, 212 women; RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 28.38; low\u2010certainty evidence) because there were very few data. We are very uncertain whether the combination of moxibustion plus usual care increases the chance of adverse events (including nausea, unpleasant odour, abdominal pain and uterine contractions; intervention: 27/65, control: 0/57), as only one study presented data in a way that could be reanalysed (122 women; RR 48.33, 95% CI 3.01 to 774.86; very low\u2013certainty evidence). When moxibustion plus usual care was compared with sham moxibustion plus usual care, we found that moxibustion probably reduces the chance of non\u2010cephalic presentation at birth (1 trial, 272 women; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and probably results in little to no effect on the rate of caesarean section (1 trial, 272 women; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). No study that compared moxibustion plus usual care with sham moxibustion plus usual care reported on the clinically important outcomes of need for ECV, premature rupture of membranes, use of oxytocin, and cord blood pH less than 7.1, and one trial that reported adverse events reported data for the whole sample. When moxibustion was combined with acupuncture and usual care, there was very little evidence about the effect of the combination on non\u2010cephalic presentation at birth (1 trial, 226 women; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.94) and at the end of treatment (2 trials, 254 women; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.93), and on the need for ECV (1 trial, 14 women; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.07 to 3.01). There was very little evidence about whether moxibustion plus acupuncture plus usual care reduced the chance of caesarean section (2 trials, 240 women; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99) or pre\u2010eclampsia (1 trial, 14 women; RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.24 to 104.15). The certainty of the evidence for this comparison was not assessed. ", "conclusion": " We found moderate\u2010certainty evidence that moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the chance of non\u2010cephalic presentation at birth, but uncertain evidence about the need for ECV. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from one study shows that moxibustion plus usual care probably reduces the use of oxytocin before or during labour. However, moxibustion plus usual care probably results in little to no difference in the rate of caesarean section, and we are uncertain about its effects on the chance of premature rupture of membranes and cord blood pH less than 7.1.

Active interventions included bisphosphonates (3 trials, 169 participants), zinc supplementation (1 trial, 42 participants), denosumab (1 trial, 63 participants), and strontium ranelate (1 trial, 24 participants). The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low and was downgraded mainly due to concerns surrounding imprecision (low participant numbers), but also risk of bias issues related to randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Bisphosphonates versus placebo or no treatment Two RCTs compared bisphosphonates to placebo or no treatment. After two years, one trial (25 participants) found that alendronate and clodronate may increase BMD Z score compared to placebo at the femoral neck (mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.58) and the lumbar spine (MD 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.23). One trial (118 participants) reported that neridronate compared to no treatment may increase BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip at six and 12 months; for the femoral neck, the study found increased BMD in the neridronate group at 12 months only. All results were of very low\u2010certainty. There were no major adverse effects of treatment. Participants in the neridronate group reported less back pain; we considered this representative of improved quality of life (QoL), though the certainty of the evidence was very low. One participant in the neridronate trial (116 participants) sustained multiple fractures as a result of a traffic accident. No trials reported BMD at the wrist or mobility. Different doses of bisphosphonate compared One 12\u2010month trial (26 participants) assessed different doses of pamidronate (60 mg versus 30 mg) and found a difference in BMD Z score favouring the 60 mg dose at the lumbar spine (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76) and forearm (MD 0.87, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.51), but no difference at the femoral neck (very low\u2010certainty evidence). This trial did not report fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment. Zinc versus placebo \u2028One trial (42 participants) showed zinc supplementation probably increased BMD Z score compared to placebo at the lumbar spine after 12 months (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.20; 37 participants) and 18 months (MD 0.34, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.40; 32 participants); the same was true for BMD at the hip after 12 months (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.19; 37 participants) and 18 months (MD 0.26, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.31; 32 participants). The evidence for these results was of moderate certainty. The trial did not report BMD at the wrist, fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment. Denosumab versus placebo \u2028Based on one trial (63 participants), we are unsure about the effect of denosumab on BMD Z score at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and wrist joint after 12 months compared to placebo (low\u2010certainty evidence). This trial did not report fracture incidence, mobility, QoL, or adverse effects of treatment, but the investigators reported a reduction in bone pain measured on a visual analogue scale in the denosumab group after 12 months of treatment compared to placebo (MD  \u2212 2.40 cm, 95% CI  \u2212 3.80 to  \u2212 1.00). Strontium ranelate \u2028One trial (24 participants) only narratively reported an increase in BMD Z score at the lumbar spine in the intervention group and no corresponding change in the control group (very low\u2010certainty evidence). This trial also found a reduction in back pain measured on a visual analogue scale after 24 months in the strontium ranelate group compared to the placebo group (MD  \u2212 0.70 cm (95% CI  \u2212 1.30 to  \u2212 0.10); we considered this measure representative of improved quality of life. ", "conclusion": " Bisphosphonates may increase BMD at the femoral neck, lumbar spine, and forearm compared to placebo after two years' therapy. Zinc supplementation probably increases BMD at the lumbar spine and hip after 12 months .  Denosumab may make little or no difference to BMD, and we are uncertain about the effect of strontium on BMD.

Sixty\u2010two of these trials contributed to the meta\u2010analysis. Sixty\u2010three studies were conducted in middle\u2010income countries (MICs), and the remaining three studies were conducted in low\u2010income countries (LICs). Twenty\u2010five trials exclusively enrolled participants with alcohol use disorder. The remaining 51 trials enrolled participants with harmful alcohol use, some of which included both cases of alcohol use disorder and people reporting hazardous alcohol use patterns that did not meet criteria for disorder. Fifty\u2010two RCTs assessed the efficacy of psychosocial interventions; 27 were brief interventions primarily based on motivational interviewing and were compared to brief advice, information, or assessment only. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to brief interventions given the high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Studies reporting continuous outcomes: Tau\u00b2 = 0.15, Q =139.64, df =16, P<.001, I\u00b2 = 89%, 3913 participants, 17 trials, very low certainty; Studies reporting dichotomous outcomes: Tau\u00b2=0.18, Q=58.26, df=3, P<.001, I\u00b2 =95%, 1349 participants, 4 trials, very low certainty). The other types of psychosocial interventions included a range of therapeutic approaches such as behavioral risk reduction, cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy, contingency management, rational emotive therapy, and relapse prevention. These interventions were most commonly compared to usual care involving varying combinations of psychoeducation, counseling, and pharmacotherapy. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to psychosocial treatments due to high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Heterogeneity: Tau\u00b2 = 1.15; Q = 444.32, df = 11, P<.001; I\u00b2=98%, 2106 participants, 12 trials, very low certainty). Eight trials compared combined pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions with placebo, psychosocial intervention alone, or another pharmacologic treatment. The active pharmacologic study conditions included disulfiram, naltrexone, ondansetron, or topiramate. The psychosocial components of these interventions included counseling, encouragement to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, motivational interviewing, brief cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy, or other psychotherapy (not specified). Analysis of studies comparing a combined pharmacologic and psychosocial intervention to psychosocial intervention alone found that the combined approach may be associated with a greater reduction in harmful alcohol use (standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD))=\u20100.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): \u20100.61 to \u20100.24; 475 participants; 4 trials; low certainty). Four trials compared pharmacologic intervention alone with placebo and three with another pharmacotherapy. Drugs assessed were: acamprosate, amitriptyline, baclofen disulfiram, gabapentin, mirtazapine, and naltrexone. None of these trials evaluated the primary clinical outcome of interest, harmful alcohol use.   Thirty\u2010one trials reported rates of retention in the intervention. Meta\u2010analyses revealed that rates of retention between study conditions did not differ in any of the comparisons (pharmacologic risk ratio (RR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.44, 247 participants, 3 trials, low certainty; pharmacologic in addition to psychosocial intervention: RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.40, 363 participants, 3 trials, moderate certainty). Due to high levels of heterogeneity, we did not calculate pooled estimates comparing retention in brief (Heterogeneity: Tau\u00b2 = 0.00; Q = 172.59, df = 11, P<.001; I 2  = 94%; 5380 participants; 12 trials, very low certainty) or other psychosocial interventions (Heterogeneity: Tau\u00b2 = 0.01; Q = 34.07, df = 8, P<.001; I 2  = 77%; 1664 participants; 9 trials, very low certainty). Two pharmacologic trials and three combined pharmacologic and psychosocial trials reported on side effects. These studies found more side effects attributable to amitriptyline relative to mirtazapine, naltrexone and topiramate relative to placebo, yet no differences in side effects between placebo and either acamprosate or ondansetron. Across all intervention types there was substantial risk of bias. Primary threats to validity included lack of blinding and differential/high rates of attrition. ", "conclusion": " In LMICs there is low\u2010certainty evidence supporting the efficacy of combined psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use relative to psychosocial interventions alone. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of pharmacologic or psychosocial interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use largely due to the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, comparisons, and interventions that precluded pooling of these data in meta\u2010analyses. The majority of studies are brief interventions, primarily among men, and using measures that have not been validated in the target population. Confidence in these results is reduced by the risk of bias and significant heterogeneity among studies as well as the heterogeneity of results on different outcome measures within studies. More evidence on the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions, specific types of psychosocial interventions are needed to increase the certainty of these results. "}

The majority of the studies had insufficient information to allow judgement of risk of bias and we judged them to be unclear for all domains. Nine anticholinergic drugs were included in these studies: darifenacin; fesoterodine; imidafenacin; oxybutynin; propantheline; propiverine; solifenacin; tolterodine and trospium. No studies were found that compared anticholinergic drugs to no treatment. At the end of the treatment period, anticholinergics may slightly increase condition\u2010specific quality of life (mean difference (MD) 4.41 lower, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.28 lower to 3.54 lower (scale range \u2010100 to 0); 12 studies, 6804 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Anticholinergics are probably better than placebo in terms of patient perception of cure or improvement (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.66; 9 studies, 8457 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and the mean number of urgency episodes per 24\u2010hour period (MD 0.85 lower, 95% CI 1.03 lower to 0.67 lower; 23 studies, 16,875 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

Studies were conducted in the USA (10), Canada (five), Australia (two), the UK (two), Denmark (one) and Italy (one) with a median of 23 participants per study (range 13 to 166). Participant ages ranged from newborns to 45 years; most studies only recruited children and young people. Sixteen studies reported the sex of participants (375 males; 296 females). Most studies compared modifications of CCPT with a single comparator, but two studies compared three interventions and another compared four interventions. The interventions varied in the duration of treatments, times per day and periods of comparison making meta\u2010analysis challenging. All evidence was very low certainty. Nineteen studies reported the primary outcomes forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 )and forced vital capacity (FVC), and found no difference in change from baseline in FEV 1  % predicted or rate of decline between groups for either measure. Most studies suggested equivalence between CCPT and alternative ACTs, including positive expiratory pressure (PEP), extrapulmonary mechanical percussion, active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT), oscillating PEP devices (O\u2010PEP), autogenic drainage (AD) and exercise. Where single studies suggested superiority of one ACT, these findings were not corroborated in similar studies; pooled data generally concluded that effects of CCPT were comparable to those of alternative ACTs. CCPT versus PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function or has an impact on the number of respiratory exacerbations per year compared with PEP (both very low\u2010certainty evidence). There were no analysable data for our secondary outcomes, but many studies provided favourable narrative reports on the independence achieved with PEP mask therapy. CCPT versus extrapulmonary mechanical percussion We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared with extrapulmonary mechanical percussions (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The annual rate of decline in average forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF 25\u201375 ) was greater with high\u2010frequency chest compression compared to CCPT in medium\u2010 to long\u2010term studies, but there was no difference in any other outcome. CCPT versus ACBT We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to ACBT (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Annual decline in FEF 25\u201375  was worse in participants using the FET component of ACBT only (mean difference (MD) 6.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 11.45; 1 study, 63 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). One short\u2010term study reported that directed coughing was as effective as CCPT for all lung function outcomes, but with no analysable data. One study found no difference in hospital admissions and days in hospital for exacerbations. CCPT versus O\u2010PEP We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to O\u2010PEP devices (Flutter device and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation); however, only one study provided analysable data (very low\u2010certainty evidence). No study reported data for number of exacerbations. There was no difference in results for number of days in hospital for an exacerbation, number of hospital admissions and number of days of intravenous antibiotics; this was also true for other secondary outcomes. CCPT versus AD We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to AD (very low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies reported the number of exacerbations per year; however, one study reported more hospital admissions for exacerbations in the CCPT group (MD 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.42; 33 participants). One study provided a narrative report of a preference for AD. CCPT versus exercise We are uncertain whether CCPT improves lung function compared to exercise (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Analysis of original data from one study demonstrated a higher FEV 1  % predicted (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004), FVC (MD 7.83, 95% CI 2.48 to 13.18; P = 0.004) and FEF 25\u201375  (MD 7.05, 95% CI 3.15 to 10.95; P = 0.0004) in the CCPT group; however, the study reported no difference between groups (likely because the original analysis accounted for baseline differences). ", "conclusion": " We are uncertain whether CCPT has a more positive impact on respiratory function, respiratory exacerbations, individual preference, adherence, quality of life, exercise capacity and other outcomes when compared to alternative ACTs as the certainty of the evidence is very low. There was no advantage in respiratory function of CCPT over alternative ACTs, but this may reflect insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence. Narrative reports indicated that participants prefer self\u2010administered ACTs. This review is limited by a paucity of well\u2010designed, adequately powered, long\u2010term studies. This review cannot yet recommend any single ACT above others; physiotherapists and people with CF may wish to try different ACTs until they find an ACT that suits them best. "}

There are nine studies awaiting classification and 13 ongoing studies. The included studies differed in the comparator treatment (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)), the devices for delivering nHF and the gas flows used. Some studies allowed the use of 'rescue' CPAP in the event of nHF treatment failure, prior to any mechanical ventilation, and some allowed surfactant administration via the INSURE (INtubation, SURfactant, Extubation) technique without this being deemed treatment failure. The studies included very few extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation. Several studies had unclear or high risk of bias in one or more domains. Nasal high flow compared with continuous positive airway pressure for primary respiratory support in preterm infants Eleven studies compared nHF with CPAP for primary respiratory support in preterm infants. When compared with CPAP, nHF may result in little to no difference in the combined outcome of death or BPD (risk ratio (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.60; risk difference (RD) 0, 95% CI \u22120.02 to 0.02; 7 studies, 1830 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

When compared with NIPPV, nHF may result in little to no difference in the combined outcome of death or BPD, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.37; RD \u22120.05, 95% CI \u22120.14 to 0.04; 2 studies, 182 infants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). nHF may result in little to no difference in the risk of death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.69; RD \u22120.02, 95% CI \u22120.10 to 0.05; 3 studies, 254 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence). nHF likely results in little to no difference in the incidence of treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry compared with NIPPV (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.79; 4 studies, 343 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), or mechanical ventilation within 72 hours of trial entry (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.33; 4 studies, 343 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). nHF likely results in a reduction in nasal trauma, compared with NIPPV (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.47; RD \u22120.17, 95% CI \u22120.24 to \u22120.10; 3 studies, 272 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). nHF likely results in little to no difference in the rate of pneumothorax (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.53; 4 studies, 344 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Nasal high flow compared with ambient oxygen We found no studies examining this comparison. Nasal high flow compared with low flow nasal cannulae We found no studies examining this comparison. ", "conclusion": " The use of nHF for primary respiratory support in preterm infants of 28 weeks' gestation or greater may result in little to no difference in death or BPD, compared with CPAP or NIPPV. nHF likely results in an increase in treatment failure within 72 hours of trial entry compared with CPAP; however, it likely does not increase the rate of mechanical ventilation. Compared with CPAP, nHF use likely results in less nasal trauma and likely a reduction in pneumothorax. As few extremely preterm infants less than 28 weeks' gestation were enrolled in the included trials, evidence is lacking for the use of nHF for primary respiratory support in this population. "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD013798.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To evaluate and compare the benefits and harms of first\u2010line therapies for adults with advanced RCC, and to produce a clinically relevant ranking of therapies. Secondary objectives were to maintain the currency of the evidence by conducting continuous update searches, using a living systematic review approach, and to incorporate data from clinical study reports (CSRs). \n\nMain results:\n We included 36 RCTs and 15,177 participants (11,061 males and 4116 females). Risk of bias was predominantly judged as being 'high' or 'some concerns' across most trials and outcomes. This was mainly due to a lack of information about the randomisation process, the blinding of outcome assessors, and methods for outcome measurements and analyses. Additionally, study protocols and statistical analysis plans were rarely available. Here we present the results for our primary outcomes OS, QoL, and SAEs, and for all risk groups combined for contemporary treatments: pembrolizumab + axitinib (PEM+AXI), avelumab + axitinib (AVE+AXI), nivolumab + cabozantinib (NIV+CAB), lenvatinib + pembrolizumab (LEN+PEM), nivolumab + ipilimumab (NIV+IPI), CAB, and pazopanib (PAZ). Results per risk group and results for our secondary outcomes are reported in the summary of findings tables and in the full text of this review. The evidence on other treatments and comparisons can also be found in the full text. Overall survival (OS) Across risk groups, PEM+AXI (HR 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 1.07, moderate certainty) and NIV+IPI (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.00, moderate certainty) probably improve OS, compared to SUN, respectively. LEN+PEM may improve OS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03, low certainty), compared to SUN. There is probably little or no difference in OS between PAZ and SUN (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.32, moderate certainty), and we are uncertain whether CAB improves OS when compared to SUN (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.64, very low certainty). The median survival is 28 months when treated with SUN. Survival may improve to 43 months with LEN+PEM, and probably improves to: 41 months with NIV+IPI, 39 months with PEM+AXI, and 31 months with PAZ. We are uncertain whether survival improves to 34 months with CAB. Comparison data were not available for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. Quality of life (QoL) One RCT measured QoL using FACIT\u2010F (score range 0 to 52; higher scores mean better QoL) and reported that the mean post\u2010score was 9.00 points higher (9.86 lower to 27.86 higher, very low certainty) with PAZ than with SUN. Comparison data were not available for PEM+AXI, AVE+AXI, NIV+CAB, LEN+PEM, NIV+IPI, and CAB. Serious adverse events (SAEs) Across risk groups, PEM+AXI probably increases slightly the risk for SAEs (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.85, moderate certainty) compared to SUN. LEN+PEM (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.19, moderate certainty) and NIV+IPI (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.97, moderate certainty) probably increase the risk for SAEs, compared to SUN, respectively. There is probably little or no difference in the risk for SAEs between PAZ and SUN (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.31, moderate certainty). We are uncertain whether CAB reduces or increases the risk for SAEs (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.43, very low certainty) when compared to SUN. People have a mean risk of 40% for experiencing SAEs when treated with SUN. The risk increases probably to: 61% with LEN+PEM, 57% with NIV+IPI, and 52% with PEM+AXI. It probably remains at 40% with PAZ. We are uncertain whether the risk reduces to 37% with CAB. Comparison data were not available for AVE+AXI and NIV+CAB. ", "conclusion": " Findings concerning the main treatments of interest comes from direct evidence of one trial only, thus results should be interpreted with caution. More trials are needed where these interventions and combinations are compared head\u2010to\u2010head, rather than just to SUN. Moreover, assessing the effect of immunotherapies and targeted therapies on different subgroups is essential and studies should focus on assessing and reporting relevant subgroup data. The evidence in this review mostly applies to advanced clear cell RCC. "}

All included studies were published after 2005. Interventions included seven parenting interventions, eight psychological interventions and two service system approaches. The studies were funded by major research councils, government departments and philanthropic/charitable organisations. All evidence was of low or very low certainty. Parenting interventions Evidence was very uncertain from a study (33 participants) assessing the effects of a parenting intervention compared to attention control on trauma\u2010related symptoms, and psychological wellbeing symptoms (postpartum depression), in mothers who had experienced childhood maltreatment and were experiencing current parenting risk factors. Evidence suggested that parenting interventions may improve parent\u2010child relationships slightly compared to usual service provision (SMD 0.45, 95% CI \u20100.06 to 0.96; I 2  = 60%; 2 studies, 153 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between parenting interventions and usual perinatal service in parenting skills including nurturance, supportive presence and reciprocity (SMD 0.25, 95% CI \u20100.07 to 0.58; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 149 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of parenting interventions on parents' substance use, relationship quality or self\ufffd\ufffdharm. Psychological interventions Psychological interventions may result in little or no difference in trauma\u2010related symptoms compared to usual care (SMD \u20100.05, 95% CI \u20100.40 to 0.31; I 2  = 39%; 4 studies, 247 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Psychological interventions may make little or no difference compared to usual care to depression symptom severity (8 studies, 507 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence, SMD \u20100.34, 95% CI \u20100.66 to \u20100.03; I 2  = 63%). An interpersonally focused cognitive behavioural analysis system of psychotherapy may slightly increase the number of pregnant women who quit smoking compared to usual smoking cessation therapy and prenatal care (189 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). A psychological intervention may slightly improve parents' relationship quality compared to usual care (1 study, 67 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Benefits for parent\u2010child relationships were very uncertain (26 participants, very low\u2010certainty evidence), while there may be a slight improvement in parenting skills compared to usual care (66 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of psychological interventions on parents' self\u2010harm. Service system approaches One service system approach assessed the effect of a financial empowerment education programme, with and without trauma\u2010informed peer support, compared to usual care for parents with low incomes. The interventions increased depression slightly (52 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies assessed the effects of service system interventions on parents' trauma\u2010related symptoms, substance use, relationship quality, self\u2010harm, parent\u2010child relationships or parenting skills. ", "conclusion": " There is currently a lack of high\u2010quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve parenting capacity or parental psychological or socio\u2010emotional wellbeing in parents experiencing CPTSD symptoms or who have experienced childhood maltreatment (or both). This lack of methodological rigour and high risk of bias made it difficult to interpret the findings of this review. Overall, results suggest that parenting interventions may slightly improve parent\u2010child relationships but have a small, unimportant effect on parenting skills. Psychological interventions may help some women stop smoking in pregnancy, and may have small benefits on parents' relationships and parenting skills. A financial empowerment programme may slightly worsen depression symptoms. While potential beneficial effects were small, the importance of a positive effect in a small number of parents must be considered when making treatment and care decisions. There is a need for further high\u2010quality research into effective strategies for this population. "}

Two studies examined populations who all had ulcerative colitis (UC); the remaining studies examined a mix of IBD patients (UC and Crohn's disease). Studies considered a range of disease activity states. The length of the interventions ranged from 30 minutes to 12 months. Education was provided in the form of in\u2010person workshops/lectures, and remotely via printed materials or multimedia, smartphones and internet learning. Thirteen studies compared patient education interventions plus standard care against standard care alone. The interventions included seminars, information booklets, text messages, e\u2010learning, a multi professional group\u2010based programme, guidebooks, a staff\u2010delivered programme based on an illustrated book, a standardised programme followed by group session, lectures alternating with group therapy, educational sessions based on an IBD guidebook, internet blog access and text messages, a structured education programme, and interactive videos. Risk of bias findings were concerning in all judgement areas across all studies. No single study was free of unclear or high of bias judgements. Reporting of most outcomes in a homogeneous fashion was limited, with quality of life at study end reported most commonly in six of the 14 studies which allowed for meta\u2010analysis, with all other outcomes reported in a more heterogeneous manner that limited wider analysis. Two studies provided data on disease activity. There was no clear difference in disease activity when patient education (n = 277) combined with standard care was compared to standard care (n = 202). Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in reducing disease activity in patients with IBD (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u20100.03, 95% CI \u20100.25 to 0.20), moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Two studies provided continuous data on flare\u2010up/relapse. There was no clear difference for flare\u2010ups or relapse when patient education (n = 515) combined with standard care was compared to standard care (n = 507), as a continuous outcome. Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in reducing flare\u2010ups or relapse in patients with IBD (MD \u20100.00, 95% CI \u20100.06 to 0.05; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Three studies provided dichotomous data on flare\u2010up/relapse. The evidence is very uncertain on whether patient education combined with standard care (n = 157) is different to standard care (n = 150) in reducing flare\u2010ups or relapse in patients with IBD (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.18; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Six studies provided data on quality of life. There was no clear difference in quality of life when patient education combined with standard care (n = 721) was compared to standard care (n = 643). Patient education combined with standard care is probably equivalent to standard care in improving quality of life in patients with IBD (SMD 0.08, 95% CI \u20100.03 to 0.18; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The included studies did not report major differences on healthcare access. Medication adherence, patient knowledge and change in quality of life showed conflicting results that varied between no major differences and differences in favour of the educational interventions. Only five studies reported on adverse events. Four reported zero total adverse events and one reported one case of breast cancer and two cases of surgery in their interventions groups, and zero adverse events in their control group. Two studies compared delivery methods of patient education, specifically: web\u2010based patient education interventions versus colour\u2010printed books or text messages; and one study compared frequency of patient education, specifically: weekly educational text messages versus once every other week educational text messages. These did not show major differences for disease activity and quality of life. Other outcomes were not reported. ", "conclusion": " The ways in which patient educational support surrounding IBD may impact on disease outcomes is complex. There is evidence that education added to standard care is probably of no benefit to disease activity or quality of life when compared with standard care, and may be of no benefit for occurrence of relapse when compared with standard care. However, as there was a paucity of specific information regarding the components of education or standard care, the utility of these findings is questionable. Further research on the impact of education on our primary outcomes of disease activity, flare\u2010ups/relapse and quality of life is probably not indicated. However, further research is necessary, which should focus on reporting details of the educational interventions and study outcomes that educational interventions could be directly targeted to address, such as healthcare access and medication adherence. These should be informed by direct engagement with stakeholders and people affected by Crohn's and colitis. "}

Web\u2010based monitoring versus usual care Twelve studies compared web\u2010based disease monitoring to usual care. Three studies, all in adults, provided data on disease activity. Web\u2010based disease monitoring (n = 254) is probably equivalent to usual care (n = 174) in reducing disease activity in people with IBD (SMD 0.09, 95% CI \u22120.11 to 0.29).

There may be no difference in these outcomes in children, but the evidence is limited. Web\u2010based monitoring probably increases medication adherence slightly compared to usual care. We are uncertain about the effects of web\u2010based monitoring versus usual care on our other secondary outcomes, and about the effects of the other telehealth interventions included in our review, because the evidence is limited. Further studies comparing web\u2010based disease monitoring to standard care for the clinical outcomes reported in adults are unlikely to change our conclusions, unless they have longer follow\u2010up or investigate under\u2010reported outcomes or populations.

Seven studies were conducted in the USA, five in Australia, and one in Germany. Eleven studies reported their source of funding, with five studies receiving grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. In total, 15 different funders supported the studies included in the review. We separated subgroups of children with conduct problems into three broad categories: children with co\u2010occurring conditions (e.g. emotional difficulties), parent characteristics (e.g. conflict between parents), or familial/environmental circumstances (e.g. rural families). All studies delivered a personalised intervention that was adapted or developed for a prespecified subgroup of children with conduct problems. We rated all trials at unclear or high risk of bias in most domains. Below, we report the results of improvement in child conduct problems and disruptive behaviour, personalised treatment outcomes, and parenting skills and knowledge for our main comparison: personalised versus non\u2010personalised interventions. Improvement in child conduct problems and disruptive behaviour Compared with a non\u2010personalised intervention, a personalised intervention may result in a slight improvement in child conduct problems or disruptive behaviour measured using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) Problem subscale in the short term (mean difference (MD) \u22123.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22126.06 to \u22120.02; 6 studies, 278 participants; P = 0.05), but may have little to no effect on improving child conduct problems or disruptive behaviour measured by the ECBI Intensity subscale (MD \u22126.25, 95% CI \u221216.66 to 4.15; 6 studies, 278 participants; P = 0.24), or the Externalising subscale of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (MD \u22122.19, 95% CI \u22126.97 to 2.59; 3 studies, 189 participants, P = 0.37) in the short term. We graded the certainty of evidence as very low for all three outcomes, meaning any estimate of effect is very uncertain.  Personalised treatment outcomes, relevant to each subgroup Although six studies reported personalised treatment outcomes, relevant to each subgroup, we were unable to pool the data due to differences between the measures used in the studies and the heterogeneity this would produce in analysis. The results for this outcome were inconclusive. Parenting skills and knowledge Although seven studies reported parenting skills and knowledge, we were unable to pool the data due to differences between the measures used in the studies and the heterogeneity this would produce in analysis. The results for this outcome were inconclusive.  Adverse events None of the trials reported monitoring adverse events.

", "conclusion": " There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of personalised interventions for subgroups of children with conduct problems. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was very low, meaning that we have very little confidence in the estimated effects and the true effects may be different to our findings, which will limit the relevance of our findings to clinical decisions. To overcome the limitations of the evidence, large\u2010scale RCTs are needed to determine whether personalised interventions, adapted or developed, for subgroups of children with conduct problems are effective in improving outcomes. Consensus on the most appropriate measures to use in these studies is needed in order to facilitate cross\u2010study comparisons. Persistent conduct problems predict a range of adverse long\u2010term outcomes, so future research should investigate the medium\u2010 and long\u2010term effects of personalised treatments. Studies are needed in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries as well as studies recruiting children aged between nine and 12 years, as they were under\u2010represented in the studies. "}

We aimed to study comparisons of available interventions, compared with placebo, control, with each other and with newer treatments. \n\nMain results:\n Three studies were included in this update, therefore 13 studies (997 randomised participants) met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the risk of bias was judged low in seven studies, unclear in four, low to unclear in one, and high in one study. Interventions included standard interferon, pegylated (PEG) interferon, standard or PEG interferon plus ribavirin; direct\u2010acting antivirals, and direct\u2010acting antivirals plus PEG interferon plus ribavirin. Compared to placebo or control, standard interferon may make little or no difference to death (5 studies, 134 participants: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.23) or relapse (low certainty evidence), probably improves end\u2010of\u2010treatment response (ETR) (5 studies, 132 participants: RR 8.62, 95% CI 3.03 to 24.55; I\u00b2 = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference to sustained virological response (SVR) (4 studies, 98 participants: RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 13.07; I\u00b2 = 53%), treatment discontinuation (4 studies, 116 participants: RR 4.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 42.69; I\u00b2 = 63%), and adverse events (5 studies, 143 participants: RR 3.56, 95% CI 0.98 to 13.01; I\u00b2 = 25%) (moderate certainty evidence). In low certainty evidence, PEG interferon (1 study, 50 participants) may improve ETR (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.15) but may make little or no difference to death (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.81), SVR (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.81), treatment discontinuation (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96), adverse events (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96) and relapses (21/38 relapsed) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25) compared to standard interferon. In moderate certainty evidence, high\u2010dose PEG interferon (alpha\u20102a and alpha\u20102b) may make little or no difference to death (2 studies, 97 participants: RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.76 to 24.33; I\u00b2 = 0%), ETR (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.90; I\u00b2 = 20%), SVR (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.07; I\u00b2 = 0%), treatment discontinuation (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.28; I\u00b2 = 0%) or adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.83; I\u00b2 = 27%) compared to low\u2010dose PEG interferon. High\u2010dose PEG interferon may make little or no difference to relapses (1 study, 43 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.77; low certainty evidence). There were no significant subgroup differences. Standard interferon plus ribavirin may lead to higher treatment discontinuation (1 study, 52 participants: RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.36; low certainty evidence) compared to standard interferon alone.  In low certainty evidence, PEG interferon plus ribavirin (1 study, 377 participants) may improve SVR (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.21), reduce relapses (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.48), slightly increase the number with adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.19), and may make little or no difference to ETR (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09) compared to PEG interferon alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of PEG interferon plus ribavirin on treatment discontinuation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.24) compared to PEG interferon alone. One study reported grazoprevir plus elbasvir improved ETR (173 participants: RR 174.99, 95% CI 11.03 to 2775.78; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo. It is uncertain whether telaprevir plus ribavirin (high versus low initial dose) plus PEG interferon for 24 versus 48 weeks (1 study, 35 participants) improves ETR (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56) or SVR (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.  Data on QoL, cost\u2010effectiveness, cardiovascular outcomes and peritoneal dialysis were not available. ", "conclusion": " In dialysis patients with HCV infection grazoprevir plus elbasvir probably improves ETR. There is no difference in ETR or SVR for combinations of telaprevir, ribavirin and PEG interferon given for different durations and doses. Though no longer in use, PEG interferon was more effective than standard interferon for ETR but not SVR. Increasing doses of PEG interferon did not improve responses. The addition of ribavirin to PEG interferon may result in fewer relapses, higher SVR, and higher numbers with adverse events. "}

Three studies were conducted in Australia; two in Canada; and one in each of the following: China, the Czech Republic, France, India, the Netherlands, and the USA. One study was conducted in both Israel and Italy. FMT was administered in the form of capsules or suspensions and delivered by mouth, nasoduodenal tube, enema, or colonoscopy. One study delivered FMT by both oral capsules and colonoscopy. Six studies were at overall low risk of bias, while the others had either unclear or high risk of bias. Ten studies with 468 participants, of which nine studies focused on adults and one focused on children, reported induction of clinical remission in people with UC at longest follow\u2010up (range 6 to 12 weeks) and showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of clinical remission in UC compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.84; low\u2010certainty evidence). Five studies showed that FMT may increase rates of induction of endoscopic remission in UC at longest follow\u2010up (range 8 to 12 weeks); however, the CIs around the summary estimate were wide and included a possible null effect (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.29; low\u2010certainty evidence). Nine studies with 417 participants showed that FMT may result in little to no difference in rates of any adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence was very uncertain about the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.55; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and improvement in quality of life (mean difference (MD) 15.34, 95% CI \u22123.84 to 34.52; very low\u2010certainty evidence) when FMT was used to induce remission in UC.

Two studies were conducted in Denmark, and one each in the Netherlands, Canada, Italy, and the US. Four were single\u2010center and two were multicenter studies. All studies included only adults. Five studies excluded people who were severely immunocompromised, with only one study including 10 participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy out of the 64 enrolled; these were similarly distributed between the FMT arm (4/24 or 17%) and comparison arms (6/40 or 15%). The route of administration was the upper gastrointestinal tract via a nasoduodenal tube in one study, two studies used enema only, two used colonoscopic only delivery, and one used either nasojejunal or colonoscopic delivery, depending on a clinical determination of whether the recipient could tolerate a colonoscopy. Five studies had at least one comparison group that received vancomycin. The risk of bias (RoB 2) assessments did not find an overall high risk of bias for any outcome. All six studies assessed the efficacy and safety of FMT for the treatment of rCDI. Pooled results from six studies showed that the use of FMT in immunocompetent participants with rCDI likely leads to a large increase in resolution of rCDI in the FMT group compared to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.71; P = 0.02, I 2  = 63%; 6 studies, 320 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

Most studies had selection bias, and all studies had performance and detection bias. We downgraded the evidence for all comparisons because of a high risk of bias and imprecision. Exercise plus usual pharmacological care versus placebo plus usual pharmacological care Evidence from a single small study (17 participants) that compared whole body vibration exercise to whole body placebo vibration exercise (vibrations switched off) indicated that exercise may have little to no effect on fatigue, functional capacity, and pain (low\u2010certainty evidence).

All included studies were cluster\u2010RCTs; two were conducted in India, one in the Philippines, and one in Rwanda. Health workers trained to perform CBE in the included studies were primary health workers, nurses, midwives, and community health workers. Three of the four included studies reported on the primary outcome (breast cancer stage at the time of presentation). Amongst secondary outcomes, included studies reported CBE coverage, follow\u2010up, accuracy of health worker\u2010performed CBE, and breast cancer mortality. None of the included studies reported knowledge attitude practice (KAP) outcomes and cost\u2010effectiveness.

The main results are presented below.  Newly\u2010diagnosed EOC \u2028Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), given with chemotherapy and continued as maintenance, likely results in little to no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.07; 2 studies, 2776 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence is very uncertain for PFS (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.05; 2 studies, 2746 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), although the combination results in a slight reduction in global QoL (mean difference (MD) \u20106.4, 95% CI \u20108.86 to \u20103.94; 1 study, 890 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence).

Hypertension (grade \u2265 3) was more common in arms with bevacizumab (RR 5.82, 95% CI 3.84 to 8.83; 3 studies, 1538 participants).  TKIs with chemotherapy may result in little to no difference in OS (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.11; 1 study, 282 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), likely increase PFS (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.72; 1 study, 282 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and may have little to no effect on QoL (MD 6.1, 95% CI \u20100.96 to 13.16; 1 study, 146 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

In platinum\u2010sensitive relapsed disease, bevacizumab and TKIs probably improve PFS, but may or may not improve OS. The results for TKIs in platinum\u2010resistant relapsed EOC are similar. The effects on OS or PFS in newly\u2010diagnosed EOC are less certain, with a decrease in QoL and increase in adverse events. Overall adverse events and QoL data were more variably reported than were PFS data. There appears to be a role for anti\u2010angiogenesis treatment, but given the additional treatment burden and economic costs of maintenance treatments, benefits and risks of anti\u2010angiogenesis treatments should be carefully considered.

However, men undertaking PFMT and biofeedback may be less likely to be objectively cured at from 6 to 12 months (2 studies; n = 269; low\u2010certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether undertaking PFMT and biofeedback has an effect on surface or skin\u2010related adverse events (1 study; n = 205; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or muscle\u2010related adverse events (1 study; n = 205; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Condition\u2010specific quality of life, participant adherence to the intervention and general quality of life were not reported by any study for this comparison. Combinations of conservative treatments versus no treatment, sham treatment or verbal/written instructions Eleven studies assessed this comparison. Combinations of conservative treatments may lead to little difference in the number of men being subjectively cured or improved of incontinence between 6 and 12 months (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.19; 2 studies; n = 788; low\u2010certainty evidence; in absolute terms: no treatment or sham arm: 307 per 1000 and intervention arm: 297 per 1000). Combinations of conservative treatments probably lead to little difference in condition\u2010specific quality of life (MD \u20100.28, 95% CI \u20100.86 to 0.29; 2 studies; n = 788; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and probably little difference in general quality of life between 6 and 12 months (MD \u20100.01, 95% CI \u20100.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; n = 742; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There is little difference between combinations of conservative treatments and control in terms of objective cure or improvement of incontinence between 6 and 12 months (MD 0.18, 95% CI \u20100.24 to 0.60; 2 studies; n = 565; high\u2010certainty evidence). However, it is uncertain whether participant adherence to the intervention between 6 and 12 months is increased for those undertaking combinations of conservative treatments (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.56; 2 studies; n = 763; very low\u2010certainty evidence; in absolute terms: no intervention or sham arm: 172 per 1000 and intervention arm: 358 per 1000). There is probably no difference between combinations and control in terms of the number of men experiencing surface or skin\u2010related adverse events (2 studies; n = 853; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but it is uncertain whether combinations of treatments lead to more men experiencing muscle\u2010related adverse events (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.31 to 27.41; 2 studies; n = 136; very low\u2010certainty evidence; in absolute terms: 0 per 1000 for both arms). Electrical or magnetic stimulation versus no treatment, sham treatment or verbal/written instructions We did not identify any studies for this comparison that reported on our key outcomes of interest. ", "conclusion": " Despite a total of 25 trials, the value of conservative interventions for urinary incontinence following prostate surgery alone, or in combination, remains uncertain. Existing trials are typically small with methodological flaws. These issues are compounded by a lack of standardisation of the PFMT technique and marked variations in protocol concerning combinations of conservative treatments. Adverse events following conservative treatment are often poorly documented and incompletely described. Hence, there is a need for large, high\u2010quality, adequately powered, randomised control trials with robust methodology to address this subject. "}

The risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment was low for 29 and 28 studies, respectively. Thirty\u2010six studies were at low risk of performance bias, and 23 studies were at low risk of detection bias. Twenty\u2010seven, 41, and 17 studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Forty\u2010five studies compared cranberry products with placebo or no specific treatment in six different groups of participants. Twenty\u2010six of these 45 studies could be meta\u2010analysed for the outcome of symptomatic, culture\u2010verified UTIs. In moderate certainty evidence, cranberry products reduced the risk of UTIs (6211 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84; I\u00b2 = 69%). When studies were divided into groups according to the treatment indication, cranberry products probably reduced the risk of symptomatic, culture\u2010verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs (8 studies, 1555 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.99; I\u00b2 = 54%), in children (5 studies, 504 participants: RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.68; I\u00b2 = 21%) and in people with a susceptibility to UTIs due to an intervention (6 studies, 1434 participants: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.61; I\u00b2 = 0%). However, in low certainty evidence, there may be little or no benefit in elderly institutionalised men and women (3 studies, 1489 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30; I\u00b2 = 9%), pregnant women (3 studies, 765 participants: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.50; I\u00b2 = 3%), or adults with neuromuscular bladder dysfunction with incomplete bladder emptying (3 studies, 464 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; I\u00b2 = 0%). Other comparisons were cranberry products with probiotics (three studies) or antibiotics (six studies), cranberry tablets with cranberry liquid (one study), and different doses of PACs (two studies). Compared to antibiotics, cranberry products may make little or no difference to the risk of symptomatic, culture\u2010verified UTIs (2 studies, 385 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.33; I\u00b2 = 0%) or the risk of clinical symptoms without culture (2 studies, 336 participants: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.14; I\u00b2 = 68%). Compared to probiotics, cranberry products may reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture\u2010verified UTIs (3 studies, 215 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.56; I = 0%). It is unclear whether efficacy differs between cranberry juice and tablets or between different doses of PACs as the certainty of the evidence was very low. The number of participants with gastrointestinal side effects probably does not differ between those taking cranberry products and those receiving placebo or no specific treatment (10 studies, 2166 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77; I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). There was no clear relationship between compliance with therapy and the risk for repeat UTIs. No difference in the risk for UTIs could be demonstrated between low, moderate and high doses of PACs. ", "conclusion": " This update adds a further 26 studies taking the total number of studies to 50 with 8857 participants. These data support the use of cranberry products to reduce the risk of symptomatic, culture\u2010verified UTIs in women with recurrent UTIs, in children, and in people susceptible to UTIs following interventions. The evidence currently available does not support its use in the elderly, patients with bladder emptying problems, or pregnant women. "}

We added 42 studies with 2839 participants for this update. Altogether, we included 51 different treatments for pruritus in four different patient groups. The overall risk of bias profile was heterogeneous and ranged from high to low risk. The main reason for giving a high risk of bias rating was a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Seventy\u2010nine of 91 studies (87%) had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm. Eight (9%) studies had low risk of bias in the specified key domains; the remaining studies had an unclear risk of bias (70 studies, 77%) or a high risk of bias (13 studies, 14%). Using GRADE criteria, we judged that the certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. pruritus) was high for kappa\u2010opioid agonists compared to placebo and moderate for GABA\u2010analogues compared to placebo. Certainty of evidence was low for naltrexone, fish\u2010oil/omega\u20103 fatty acids, topical capsaicin, ondansetron and zinc sulphate compared to placebo and gabapentin compared to pregabalin, and very low for cromolyn sodium, paroxetine, montelukast, flumecinol, and rifampicin compared to placebo. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to serious study limitations regarding risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. For participants suffering from uraemic pruritus (UP; also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)\u2010associated pruritus (CKD\u2010aP)), treatment with GABA\u2010analogues compared to placebo likely resulted in a large reduction of pruritus (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 10 cm): mean difference (MD) \u22125.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22125.56 to \u22124.55; five RCTs, N = 297, certainty of evidence: moderate. Treatment with kappa\u2010opioid receptor agonists (difelikefalin, nalbuphine, nalfurafine) compared to placebo reduced pruritus slightly (VAS 0 to 10 cm, MD \u22120.96, 95% CI \u22121.22 to \u22120.71; six RCTs, N = 1292, certainty of evidence: high); thus, this treatment was less effective than GABA\u2010analogues. Treatment with montelukast compared to placebo may result in a reduction of pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies, 87 participants): SMD \u22121.40, 95% CI \u22121.87 to \u20100.92; certainty of evidence: very low. Treatment with fish\u2010oil/omega\u20103 fatty acids compared to placebo may result in a large reduction of pruritus (four studies, 160 observations): SMD \u22121.60, 95% CI \u22121.97 to \u20101.22; certainty of evidence: low. Treatment with cromolyn sodium compared to placebo may result in a reduction of pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (VAS 0 to 10 cm, MD \u20103.27, 95% CI \u22125.91 to \u22120.63; two RCTs, N = 100, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with topical capsaicin compared with placebo may result in a large reduction of pruritus (two studies; 112 participants): SMD \u22121.06, 95% CI \u22121.55 to \u20100.57; certainty of evidence: low. Ondansetron, zinc sulphate and several other treatments may not reduce pruritus in participants suffering from UP. In participants with cholestatic pruritus (CP), treatment with rifampicin compared to placebo may reduce pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (VAS: 0 to 100, MD \u221242.00, 95% CI \u221287.31 to 3.31; two RCTs, N = 42, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with flumecinol compared to placebo may reduce pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR > 1 favours treatment group; RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.1; two RCTs, N = 69, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone compared to placebo may reduce pruritus (VAS: 0 to 10 cm, MD \u22122.42, 95% CI \u22123.90 to \u22120.94; two RCTs, N = 52, certainty of evidence: low). However, effects in participants with UP were inconclusive (percentage of difference \u221212.30%, 95% CI \u221225.82% to 1.22%, one RCT, N = 32). In palliative care participants with pruritus of a different nature, the treatment with the drug paroxetine (one study), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, compared to placebo may reduce pruritus slightly by 0.78 (numerical analogue scale from 0 to 10 points; 95% CI \u22121.19 to \u22120.37; one RCT, N = 48, certainty of evidence: low). Most adverse events were mild or moderate. Two interventions showed multiple major adverse events (naltrexone and nalfurafine). ", "conclusion": " Different interventions (GABA\u2010analogues, kappa\u2010opioid receptor agonists, cromolyn sodium, montelukast, fish\u2010oil/omega\u20103 fatty acids and topical capsaicin compared to placebo) were effective for uraemic pruritus. GABA\u2010analogues had the largest effect on pruritus. Rifampin, naltrexone and flumecinol tended to be effective for cholestatic pruritus. However, therapies for patients with malignancies are still lacking. Due to the small sample sizes in most meta\u2010analyses and the heterogeneous methodological quality of the included trials, the results should be interpreted cautiously in terms of generalisability.

Five trials (seven reports) used a cross\u2010over design, while the remaining 32 trials (52 reports) used a parallel design.

One was a multicentre RCT, whilst two were single\u2010centre RCTs.  The three studies were mostly similar in their risk of bias, having low or unclear risk of selection bias but a high risk of detection bias, due to the unblinded design of these studies. The studies used a variety of digital technologies to monitor symptoms such as a digital symptom diary either with or without home spirometry monitoring. As the trials only included adults and older children, we are not certain that the results would apply to younger children. One of our primary outcomes was to assess time to detection of pulmonary exacerbation and number of pulmonary exacerbations identified between the intervention and routine care groups. We were largely unable to pool results in a meta\u2010analysis due to the variety of methodologies and ways of reporting data. Two studies noted a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group and one of these also reported that the intervention group had a shorter time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio for time to first exacerbation 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.93), whilst a further study reported a shorter time to detection of exacerbations in the intervention group requiring oral or IV antibiotics compared to the control group (median: 70 (interquartile range (IQR) 123) days with intervention versus 141 (IQR 140) days with control; P = 0.02). However, all three studies were concordant in finding no probable effect on spirometry in the intervention groups when compared with their routine care groups over a 12\u2010month period.  We found that there is probably no difference between groups with regard to QoL scores across most domains except for Weight and Body Image, which favoured the usual care group. There is also probably no difference in the number of days of additional IV antibiotics needed or newly detected pathogens. No studies reported serious adverse events directly linked to the intervention and one study reported their smartphone application was generally well received. ", "conclusion": " Pulmonary exacerbations are universally accepted to be detrimental to progression of CF\u2010related lung disease, therefore, it is intuitive that early detection and intervention would help to improve outcomes. Digital technology provides an opportunity to detect physiological and symptomatic changes to identify exacerbations early.  Our review found that digital technologies based on recording physiological change (spirometry) and symptoms probably allow earlier identification of exacerbations as a group. However, this may not reduce the number of exacerbations warranting IV antibiotics and there is probably no effect on lung function. This may be partly due to inconsistent definitions of pulmonary exacerbations and discrepancy in the management strategies for pulmonary exacerbations. Overall, the intervention may make little or no difference to QoL scores.  The adherence to and uptake of digital technologies, especially those which include physiological measurements, are not well sustained and the costs of these need to be balanced against the clinical efficacy.

Compared with placebo, participants receiving perampanel were more likely to experience ataxia (RR 14.32, 99% CI 1.09 to 188.31; 2 trials, 1098 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), dizziness (RR 2.87, 99% CI 1.45 to 5.70; 7 trials, 2524 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), and somnolence (RR 1.76, 99% CI 1.02 to 3.04; 7 trials, 2524 participants). Subgroup analysis indicated that a larger proportion of participants who received perampanel at a dose of 4 mg/day (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.83; 2 trials, 710 participants), 8 mg/day (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.22; 4 trials, 1227 participants), or 12 mg/day (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.04; 3 trials, 869 participants) achieved a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo; however, treatment with perampanel 12 mg/day also increased treatment withdrawal (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.40; 3 trials, 869 participants).

Although perampanel was well\u2010tolerated, there was a higher proportion of treatment withdrawals with perampanel compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis suggested that 8 mg/day and 12 mg/day are the most efficacious perampanel doses; however, the use of 12 mg/day would likely increase the number of treatment withdrawals. Future research should focus on investigating the efficacy and tolerability of perampanel with longer\u2010term follow\u2010up, as well as exploring an optimal dose. "}

There were differences between studies in how the interventions were delivered, with several intervention groups combining more than one ACT. One study used autogenic drainage; five used conventional chest physiotherapy; nine used positive expiratory pressure (PEP), with one study varying the water pressure between arms; three studies used oscillating PEP; two used exercise; and two used high\u2010frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO). Of the 12 included studies, 10 were single\u2010treatment studies, and two delivered the intervention over two consecutive days (once daily in one study, twice daily in the second). This substantial heterogeneity in the treatment interventions precluded pooling of data for meta\u2010analysis. Blinding of participants, caregivers, and clinicians is impossible in airway clearance studies; we therefore judged all studies at unclear risk of performance bias. Lack of information in eight studies made assessment of risk of bias unclear for most other domains.  We rated the certainty of evidence as low or very low due to the short\u2010term cross\u2010over trial design, small numbers of participants, and uncertain risk of bias across most or all domains. Six studies (84 participants) reported no effect on pulmonary function variables following intervention; but one study (14 participants) reported an improvement in pulmonary function following the intervention in some of the treatment groups.

Five studies (55 participants) reported that ACTs, including coughing, increased radioactive tracer clearance compared to control, while a further study (eight participants) reported no improvement in radioactive tracer clearance when comparing PEP to control, although coughing was discouraged during the PEP intervention. We rated the certainty of evidence on the effect of ACTs on radioactive tracer clearance as very low.

Eleven trials await classification due to insufficient data for eligibility assessment. All included trials were randomised, parallel\u2010group, controlled trials, of which 30 were double\u2010blinded. Twelve trials were conducted in Asia, five in North America, one in South America, seven in Europe, and nine in Mediterranean and Middle East regions.

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ketamine on pain score during the procedure compared with placebo or fentanyl. We found no evidence on NSAIDs or studies comparing different routes of administration. Future research should prioritize large studies evaluating non\u2010opioid analgesics in this population. As the studies included in this review suggest potential positive effects of ketamine administration, studies evaluating ketamine are of interest. Furthermore, as we identified no studies on NSAIDs, which are widely used in older infants, or comparing different routes of administration, such studies should be a priority going forward.  "}

Each trial was conducted in a different country: two in China, and one each in Brazil, Egypt, and Japan. All five RCTs included both men and women; the mean age of participants was 55 years or older. Two RCTs compared intravitreal bevacizumab combined with Ahmed valve implantation and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) with Ahmed valve implantation and PRP alone. One RCT randomized participants to receive an injection of either intravitreal aflibercept or placebo at the first visit, followed by non\u2010randomized treatment according to clinical findings after one week. The remaining two RCTs randomized participants to PRP with and without ranibizumab, one of which had insufficient details for further analysis. We assessed the RCTs to have an unclear risk of bias for most domains due to insufficient information to permit judgment.   Four RCTs examined achieving control of IOP, three of which reported our time points of interest. Only one RCT reported our critical time point at one month; it found that the anti\u2010VEGF group had a 1.3\u2010fold higher chance of achieving control of IOP at one month (RR 1.32, 95% 1.10 to 1.59; 93 participants) than the non\u2010anti\u2010VEGF group (low certainty of evidence). For other time points, one RCT found a three\u2010fold greater achievement in control of IOP in the anti\u2010VEGF group when compared with the non\u2010anti\u2010VEGF group at one year (RR 3.00; 95% CI:1.35 to 6.68; 40 participants). However, another RCT found an inconclusive result at the time period ranging from 1.5 years to three years (RR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.75; 40 participants).  All five RCTs examined mean IOP, but at different time points. Very\u2010low\u2010certainty evidence showed that anti\u2010VEGFs were effective in reducing mean IOP by 6.37 mmHg (95% CI: \u201010.09 to \u20102.65; 3 RCTs; 173 participants) at four to six weeks when compared with no anti\u2010VEGFs.  Anti\u2010VEGFs may reduce mean IOP at three months (MD \u20104.25; 95% CI \u201012.05 to 3.54; 2 studies; 75 participants), six months (MD \u20105.93; 95% CI \u201018.13 to 6.26; 2 studies; 75 participants), one year (MD \u20105.36; 95% CI \u201018.50 to 7.77; 2 studies; 75 participants), and more than one year (MD \u20107.05; 95% CI \u201016.61 to 2.51; 2 studies; 75 participants) when compared with no anti\u2010VEGFs, but such effects remain uncertain. Two RCTs reported the proportion of participants who achieved an improvement in visual acuity with specified time points. Participants receiving anti\u2010VEGFs had a 2.6 times (95% CI 1.60 to 4.08; 1 study; 93 participants) higher chance of improving visual acuity when compared with those not receiving anti\u2010VEGFs at one month (very low certainty of evidence). Likewise, another RCT found a similar result at 18 months (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.33 to 12.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Two RCTs reported the outcome, complete regression of new iris vessels, at our time points of interest. Low\u2010certainty evidence showed that anti\u2010VEGFs had a nearly three times higher chance of complete regression of new iris vessels when compared with no anti\u2010VEGFs (RR 2.63, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.18; 1 study; 93 participants). A similar finding was observed at more than one year in another RCT (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.45 to 7.05; 1 study; 40 participants).  Regarding adverse events, there was no evidence that the risks of hypotony and tractional retinal detachment were different between the two groups (RR 0.67; 95% CI: 0.12 to 3.57 and RR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.01 to 7.72, respectively; 1 study; 40 participants). No RCTs reported incidents of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, no light perception, and serious adverse events. Evidence for the adverse events of anti\u2010VEGFs was low due to limitations in the study design due to insufficient information to permit judgments and imprecision of results due to the small sample size. No trial reported the proportion of participants with relief of pain and resolution of redness at any time point. ", "conclusion": " Anti\u2010VEGFs as an adjunct to conventional treatment could help reduce IOP in NVG in the short term (four to six weeks), but there is no evidence that this is likely in the longer term. Currently available evidence regarding the short\u2010 and long\u2010term effectiveness and safety of anti\u2010VEGFs in achieving control of IOP, visual acuity, and complete regression of new iris vessels in NVG is insufficient. More research is needed to investigate the effect of these medications compared with, or in addition to, conventional surgical or medical treatment in achieving these outcomes in NVG. "}

A secondary objective was to determine the efficacy of different techniques of chest physiotherapy (vibration and percussion, passive exhalation, or instrumental). \n\nMain results:\n Our update of the searches dated 20 April 2022 identified five new RCTs with 430 participants. We included a total of 17 RCTs (1679 participants) comparing chest physiotherapy with no intervention or comparing different types of physiotherapy. Five trials (246 participants) assessed percussion and vibration techniques plus postural drainage (conventional chest physiotherapy), and 12 trials (1433 participants) assessed different passive flow\u2010oriented expiratory techniques, of which three trials (628 participants) assessed forced expiratory techniques, and nine trials (805 participants) assessed slow expiratory techniques. In the slow expiratory subgroup, two trials (78 participants) compared the technique with instrumental physiotherapy techniques, and two recent trials (116 participants) combined slow expiratory techniques with rhinopharyngeal retrograde technique (RRT). One trial used RRT alone as the main component of the physiotherapy intervention. Clinical severity was mild in one trial, severe in four trials, moderate in six trials, and mild to moderate in five trials. One study did not report clinical severity. Two trials were performed on non\u2010hospitalised participants. Overall risk of bias was high in six trials, unclear in five, and low in six trials. The analyses showed no effects of conventional techniques on change in bronchiolitis severity status, respiratory parameters, hours with oxygen supplementation, or length of hospital stay (5 trials, 246 participants).  Regarding instrumental techniques (2 trials, 80 participants), one trial observed similar results in bronchiolitis severity status when comparing slow expiration to instrumental techniques (mean difference 0.10, 95% confidence interval (C) \u22120.17 to 0.37).  Forced passive expiratory techniques failed to show an effect on bronchiolitis severity in time to recovery (2 trials, 509 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) and time to clinical stability (1 trial, 99 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) in infants with severe bronchiolitis. Important adverse effects were reported with the use of forced expiratory techniques.  Regarding slow expiratory techniques, a mild to moderate improvement was observed in bronchiolitis severity score (standardised mean difference \u22120.43, 95% CI \u22120.73 to \u22120.13; I 2  = 55%; 7 trials, 434 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Also, in one trial an improvement in time to recovery was observed with the use of slow expiratory techniques. No benefit was observed in length of hospital stay, except for one trial which showed a one\u2010day reduction. No effects were shown or reported for other clinical outcomes such as duration on oxygen supplementation, use of bronchodilators, or parents' impression of physiotherapy benefit. ", "conclusion": " We found low\u2010certainty evidence that passive slow expiratory technique may result in a mild to moderate improvement in bronchiolitis severity when compared to control. This evidence comes mostly from infants with moderately acute bronchiolitis treated in hospital. The evidence was limited with regard to infants with severe bronchiolitis and those with moderately severe bronchiolitis treated in ambulatory settings. We found high\u2010certainty evidence that conventional techniques and forced expiratory techniques result in no difference in bronchiolitis severity or any other outcome. We found high\u2010certainty evidence that forced expiratory techniques in infants with severe bronchiolitis do not improve their health status and can lead to severe adverse effects. Currently, the evidence regarding new physiotherapy techniques such as RRT or instrumental physiotherapy is scarce, and further trials are needed to determine their effects and potential for use in infants with moderate bronchiolitis, as well as the potential additional effect of RRT when combined with slow passive expiratory techniques. Finally, the effectiveness of combining chest physiotherapy with hypertonic saline should also be investigated. "}

All trials were small (median number of participants 88). The methods used to generate the randomisation sequence and ensure allocation concealment were unclear in about half of the trial reports. Lack of measures to blind caregivers or investigators was a potential source of bias in all of the included trials. The trials took place during the past 25 years in care facilities internationally, predominantly in India (five trials) and Iran (four trials). The studied pressure sources were commercially available bubble CPAP devices versus a variety of mechanical ventilator (11 trials) or Infant Flow Driver (4 trials) devices.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011006.pub4", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage). \n\nMain results:\n We identified 14 studies (1364 participants), 10 of which contributed to the meta\u2010analysis for the primary outcome. Six of these compared antidepressants and placebo, three compared two antidepressants, and one three\u2010armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update, we included four additional studies, three of which contributed data for the primary outcome. For acute\u2010phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks), antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, even though the evidence is very uncertain. This was true when depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.92 to \u22120.12; 7 studies, 511 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and when measured as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96; 5 studies, 662 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies reported data on follow\u2010up response (more than 12 weeks). In head\u2010to\u2010head comparisons, we retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and for mirtazapine versus TCAs. There was no difference between the various classes of antidepressants (continuous outcome: SSRI versus TCA: SMD \u22120.08, 95% CI \u22120.34 to 0.18; 3 studies, 237 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence; mirtazapine versus TCA: SMD \u22124.80, 95% CI \u22129.70 to 0.10; 1 study, 25 participants). There was a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants versus placebo for the secondary efficacy outcomes (continuous outcome, response at one to four weeks; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There were no differences for these outcomes when comparing two different classes of antidepressants, even though the evidence was very uncertain. In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 9 studies, 889 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and TCAs (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.22; 3 studies, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the heterogeneous quality of the studies, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide CIs, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity. ", "conclusion": " Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were few and of low quality. This review found a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants against placebo in depressed participants with cancer. However, the certainty of evidence is very low and, on the basis of these results, it is difficult to draw clear implications for practice. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head\u2010to\u2010head data, the choice of which drug to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of people with major depression, also taking into account that data on people with other serious medical conditions suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. Furthermore, this update shows that the usage of the newly US Food and Drug Administration\u2010approved antidepressant esketamine in its intravenous formulation might represent a potential treatment for this specific population of people, since it can be used both as an anaesthetic and an antidepressant. However, data are too inconclusive and further studies are needed. We conclude that to better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder.

The proportion of women with dense breasts ranged from 48% to 100%. Five studies used digital mammography; one study used breast tomosynthesis; and two studies used automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) in addition to mammography screening. One study used digital mammography alone or in combination with breast tomosynthesis and ABUS or handheld ultrasonography. Six of the eight studies evaluated the rate of cancer cases detected after one screening round, whilst two studies screened women once, twice, or more. None of the studies assessed whether mammography screening in combination with ultrasonography led to lower mortality from breast cancer or all\u2010cause mortality. High certainty evidence from one trial showed that screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography detects more breast cancer than mammography alone. The J\u2010START (Japan Strategic Anti\u2010cancer Randomised Trial), enrolling 72,717 asymptomatic women, had a low risk of bias and found that two additional breast cancers per 1000 women were detected over two years with one additional ultrasonography than with mammography alone (5 versus 3 per 1000; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.94). Low certainty evidence showed that the percentage of invasive tumours was similar, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (69.6% (128 of 184) versus 73.5% (86 of 117); RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.09). However, positive lymph node status was detected less frequently in women with invasive cancer who underwent mammography screening in combination with ultrasonography than in women who underwent mammography alone (18% (23 of 128) versus 34% (29 of 86); RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.86; moderate certainty evidence). Further, interval carcinomas occurred less frequently in the group screened by mammography and ultrasonography compared with mammography alone (5 versus 10 in 10,000 women; RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.89; 72,717 participants; high certainty evidence). False\u2010negative results were less common when ultrasonography was used in addition to mammography than with mammography alone: 9% (18 of 202) versus 23% (35 of 152; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). However, the number of false\u2010positive results and necessary biopsies were higher in the group with additional ultrasonography screening. Amongst 1000 women who do not have cancer, 37 more received a false\u2010positive result when they participated in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography than with mammography alone (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.50; high certainty evidence). Compared to mammography alone, for every 1000 women participating in screening with a combination of mammography and ultrasonography, 27 more women will have a biopsy (RR 2.49, 95% CI 2.28 to 2.72; high certainty evidence). Results from cohort studies with methodological limitations confirmed these findings. A secondary analysis of the J\u2010START provided results from 19,213 women with dense and non\u2010dense breasts. In women with dense breasts, the combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected three more cancer cases (0 fewer to 7 more) per 1000 women screened than mammography alone (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.72; 11,390 participants; high certainty evidence). A meta\u2010analysis of three cohort studies with data from 50,327 women with dense breasts supported this finding, showing that mammography and ultrasonography combined led to statistically significantly more diagnosed cancer cases compared to mammography alone (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.56; 50,327 participants; moderate certainty evidence). For women with non\u2010dense breasts, the secondary analysis of the J\u2010START study demonstrated that more cancer cases were detected when adding ultrasound to mammography screening compared to mammography alone (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.68; 7823 participants; moderate certainty evidence), whilst two cohort studies with data from 40,636 women found no statistically significant difference between the two screening methods (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.49; low certainty evidence).

Thirty\u2010two further studies were found after the updated search on 5 July 2022 and are awaiting classification. The sampled studies were from 24 different countries: 17 studies were from the African region, seven were from the region of the Americas, seven were from the European region, six were from the South\u2010East Asian region, three from the Western Pacific region and one study was multiregional, covering both the African and the Eastern Mediterranean regions.

Our GRADE\u2010CERQual assessment indicated we had mainly moderate\u2010 and high\u2010confidence findings. We found that recipients perceived the cash transfers as necessary and helpful for immediate needs and, in some cases, helpful for longer\u2010term benefits. However, across conditional and unconditional programmes, recipients often felt that the amount given was too little in relation to their total needs. They also felt that the cash alone was not enough to change their behaviour and, to change behaviour, additional types of support would be required. The cash transfer was reported to have important effects on empowerment, autonomy and agency, but also in some settings, recipients experienced pressure from family or programme staff on cash usage. The cash transfer was reported to improve social cohesion and reduce intrahousehold tension. However, in settings where some received the cash and others did not, the lack of an equal approach caused tension, suspicion and conflict. Recipients also reported stigma in terms of cash transfer programme assessment processes and eligibility, as well as inappropriate eligibility processes. Across settings, recipients experienced barriers in accessing the cash transfer programme, and some refused or were hesitant to receive the cash. Some recipients found cash transfer programmes more acceptable when they agreed with the programme's goals and processes.   ", "conclusion": " Our findings highlight the impact of the sociocultural context on the functioning and interaction between the individual, family and cash transfer programmes. Even where the goals of a cash transfer programme are explicitly health\u2010related, the outcomes may be far broader than health alone and may include, for example, reduced stigma, empowerment and increased agency of the individual. When measuring programme outcomes, therefore, these broader impacts could be considered for understanding the health and well\u2010being benefits of cash transfers.   "}

", "conclusion": " Low\u2010 to moderate\u2010quality evidence shows mechanical induction with a balloon is probably as effective as induction of labour with vaginal PGE2. However, a balloon seems to have a more favourable safety profile. More research on this comparison does not seem warranted. Moderate\u2010quality evidence shows a balloon catheter may be slightly less effective as oral misoprostol, but it remains unclear if there is a difference in safety outcomes for the neonate. When compared to low\u2010dose vaginal misoprostol, low\u2010quality evidence shows a balloon may be less effective, but probably has a better safety profile. Future research could be focused more on safety aspects for the neonate and maternal satisfaction. "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD009384.pub3", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the effects of zinc supplementation for preventing mortality and morbidity, and for promoting growth, in children aged 6 months to 12 years. \n\nMain results:\n We included 16 new studies in this review, resulting in a total of 96 RCTs with 219,584 eligible participants. The included studies were conducted in 34 countries; 87 of them in low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries. Most of the children included in this review were under five years of age. The intervention was delivered most commonly in the form of syrup as zinc sulfate, and the most common dose was between 10 mg and 15 mg daily. The median duration of follow\u2010up was 26 weeks. We did not consider that the evidence for the key analyses of morbidity and mortality outcomes was affected by risk of bias. High\u2010certainty evidence showed little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality with preventive zinc supplementation compared to no zinc (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.03; 16 studies, 17 comparisons, 143,474 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence showed that preventive zinc supplementation compared to no zinc likely results in little to no difference in mortality due to all\u2010cause diarrhea (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.31; 4 studies, 132,321 participants); but probably reduces mortality due to LRTI (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 3 studies, 132,063 participants) and mortality due to malaria (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.06; 2 studies, 42,818 participants); however, the confidence intervals around the summary estimates for these outcomes were wide, and we could not rule out a possibility of increased risk of mortality. Preventive zinc supplementation likely reduces the incidence of all\u2010cause diarrhea (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.93; 39 studies, 19,468 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) but results in little to no difference in morbidity due to LRTI (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; 19 studies, 10,555 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence) compared to no zinc. There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence that preventive zinc supplementation likely leads to a slight increase in height (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14; 74 studies, 20,720 participants). Zinc supplementation was associated with an increase in the number of participants with at least one vomiting episode (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.46; 5 studies, 35,192 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). We report a number of other outcomes, including the effect of zinc supplementation on weight and serum markers such as zinc, hemoglobin, iron, copper, etc. We also performed a number of subgroup analyses and there was a consistent finding for a number of outcomes that co\u2010supplementation of zinc with iron decreased the beneficial effect of zinc. ", "conclusion": " Even though we included 16 new studies in this update, the overall conclusions of the review remain unchanged. Zinc supplementation might help prevent episodes of diarrhea and improve growth slightly, particularly in children aged 6 months to 12 years of age. The benefits of preventive zinc supplementation may outweigh the harms in regions where the risk of zinc deficiency is relatively high. "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD013766.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n The primary objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of psychological interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The secondary objective was to establish the most effective components, or behaviour change techniques (BCTs), used in these interventions. \n\nMain results:\n We included 10 trials (1642 participants) in the review (children and adolescents in four trials; adults in five trials; and children and adults in one trial). Nine trials compared a psychological intervention with usual care; we could combine data from some of these in a number of quantitative analyses. One trial compared a psychological intervention with an active comparator (education plus problem\u2010solving (EPS)). We identified five ongoing trials. Psychological interventions were generally multi\u2010component and complex, containing an average of 9.6 BCTs (range 1 to 28). The two most commonly used BCTs included 'problem\u2010solving' and 'instruction on how to perform the behaviour'. Interventions varied in their type, content and mode of delivery. They included a problem\u2010solving intervention; a paper\u2010based self\u2010management workbook; a telehealth intervention; a group training programme; a digital intervention comprising medication reminders and lung function self\u2010monitoring; a life\u2010coaching intervention; a motivational interviewing (MI) intervention; a brief MI intervention (behaviour change counselling); and a digital intervention combined with behaviour change sessions. Intervention duration ranged from 10 weeks to 12 months. Assessment time points ranged from six to eight weeks up to 23 months. Psychological interventions compared with usual care We report data here for the 'over six months and up to 12 months' time point. We found that psychological interventions probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies (primary outcome) in people with CF compared with usual care (mean difference (MD) 9.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.60 to 10.40; 1 study, 588 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in our second primary outcome, treatment\u2010related adverse events: anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI \u20100.40 to 1.00; 1 study, 535 participants), or depression (MD \u20100.10, 95% CI \u20100.80 to 0.60; 1 study, 534 participants), although this was low\u2010certainty evidence. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of a difference between groups in terms of lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted MD 1.40, 95% CI \u20100.20 to 3.00; 1 study, 556 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); number of pulmonary exacerbations (adjusted rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.11; 1 study, 607 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); or respiratory symptoms (MD 0.70, 95% CI \u20102.40 to 3.80; 1 study, 534 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, psychological interventions may improve treatment burden (MD 3.90, 95% CI 1.20 to 6.60; 1 study, 539 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate across these outcomes. Reasons for downgrading included indirectness (current evidence included adults only whereas our review question was broader and focused on people of any age) and lack of blinding of outcome assessors. Psychological interventions compared with an active comparator For this comparison the overall certainty of evidence was very low, based on one trial (n = 128) comparing an MI intervention to EPS for 12 months. We are uncertain whether an MI intervention, compared with EPS, improves adherence to inhaled therapies, lung function, or quality of life in people with CF, or whether there is an effect on pulmonary exacerbations. The included trial for this comparison did not report on treatment\u2010related adverse events (anxiety and depression). We downgraded all reported outcomes due to small participant numbers, indirectness (trials included only adults), and unclear risk of bias (e.g. selection and attrition bias). ", "conclusion": " Due to the limited quantity of trials included in this review, as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity, it was not possible to identify an overall intervention effect using meta\u2010analysis. Some moderate\u2010certainty evidence suggests that psychological interventions (compared with usual care) probably improve adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF, without increasing treatment\u2010related adverse events, anxiety and depression (low\u2010certainty evidence). In future review updates (with ongoing trial results included), we hope to be able to establish the most effective BCTs (or 'active ingredients') of interventions for improving adherence to inhaled therapies in people with CF. Wherever possible, investigators should make use of the most objective measures of adherence available (e.g. data\u2010logging nebulisers) to accurately determine intervention effects. Outcome reporting needs to be improved to enable combining or separation of measures as appropriate. Likewise, trial reporting needs to include details of intervention content (e.g. BCTs used); duration; intensity; and fidelity. Large trials with a longer follow\u2010up period (e.g. 12 months) are needed in children with CF. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how to support adherence in 'under\u2010served' CF populations. "}

In all 7 RCTs for normotensive type 1 diabetic participants, 8 of 12 RCTs with normotensive type 2 diabetic participants, and 5 of 10 RCTs with hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants, one group was assigned to one or more antihypertensive agents and the control group to placebo. In the remaining 4 RCTs for normotensive participants with type 2 diabetes and 5 RCTs for hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants, methods of intense blood pressure control were compared to usual care. Eight trials were sponsored entirely and 10 trials partially by pharmaceutical companies; nine studies received support from other sources; and two studies did not report funding source. Study designs, populations, interventions, lengths of follow\u2010up (range less than one year to nine years), and blood pressure targets varied among the included trials. For primary review outcomes after five years of treatment and follow\u2010up, one of the seven trials for type 1 diabetics reported incidence of retinopathy and one trial reported progression of retinopathy; one trial reported a combined outcome of incidence and progression (as defined by study authors). Among normotensive type 2 diabetics, four of 12 trials reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy and two trials reported progression of retinopathy; two trials reported combined incidence and progression. Among hypertensive type 2 diabetics, six of the 10 trials reported incidence of diabetic retinopathy and two trials reported progression of retinopathy; five of the 10 trials reported combined incidence and progression. The evidence supports an overall benefit of more intensive blood pressure intervention for five\u2010year incidence of diabetic retinopathy (11 studies; 4940 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.92; I 2  = 15%; moderate certainty evidence) and the combined outcome of incidence and progression (8 studies; 6212 participants; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; I 2  = 42%; low certainty evidence). The available evidence did not support a benefit regarding five\u2010year progression of diabetic retinopathy (5 studies; 5144 participants; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.12; I 2  = 57%; moderate certainty evidence), incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, clinically significant macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage (9 studies; 8237 participants; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.04; I 2  = 31%; low certainty evidence), or loss of 3 or more lines on a visual acuity chart with a logMAR scale (2 studies; 2326 participants; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.08; I 2  = 90%; very low certainty evidence). Hypertensive type 2 diabetic participants realized more benefit from intense blood pressure control for three of the four outcomes concerning incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy. The adverse event reported most often (13 of 29 trials) was death, yielding an estimated RR 0.87 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.00; 13 studies; 13,979 participants; I 2  = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). Hypotension was reported in two trials, with an RR of 2.04 (95% CI 1.63 to 2.55; 2 studies; 3323 participants; I 2  = 37%; low certainty evidence), indicating an excess of hypotensive events among participants assigned to more intervention on blood pressure. ", "conclusion": " Hypertension is a well\u2010known risk factor for several chronic conditions for which lowering blood pressure has proven to be beneficial. The available evidence supports a modest beneficial effect of intervention to reduce blood pressure with respect to preventing diabetic retinopathy for up to five years, particularly for hypertensive type 2 diabetics. However, there was a paucity of evidence to support such intervention to slow progression of diabetic retinopathy or to affect other outcomes considered in this review among normotensive diabetics. This weakens any conclusion regarding an overall benefit of intervening on blood pressure in diabetic patients without hypertension for the sole purpose of preventing diabetic retinopathy or avoiding the need for treatment for advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy.

Mean age ranged from 52 to 67 years, and females were 0% to 46% of participants. Studies recruited across the severities of COPD. Seventeen studies were of duration longer than three months and up to six months and 19 studies were of duration longer than six months. We judged the overall risk of bias as low.  Long\u2010term (more than six months) use of ICS as monotherapy reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: rate ratio 0.88 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.94; I 2  = 48%, 5 studies, 10,097 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: mean difference (MD) \u22120.05 exacerbations per participant per year, 95% CI \u22120.07 to \u22120.02; I 2  = 78%, 5 studies, 10,316 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

There was no evidence of a difference in all\u2010cause mortality in people with COPD (odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.07; I 2  = 0%; 10 studies, 16,636 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Long\u2010term use of ICS  reduced the rate of decline in FEV 1  in people with COPD (generic inverse variance analysis: MD 6.31 mL/year benefit, 95% CI 1.76 to 10.85; I 2  = 0%; 6 studies, 9829 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; pooled means analysis: 7.28 mL/year, 95% CI 3.21 to 11.35; I 2  = 0%; 6 studies, 12,502 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Adverse events: in the long\u2010term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group, compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.88; I 2  = 55%; 9 studies, 14,831 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.91 to 3.68; 5547 participants) and hoarseness (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.74; 3523 participants). The long\u2010term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures or bone mineral density over three years. We downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate for imprecision and low for imprecision and inconsistency. ", "conclusion": " This systematic review updates the evidence base for ICS monotherapy with newly published trials to aid the ongoing assessment of their role for people with COPD. Use of ICS alone for COPD likely results in a reduction of exacerbation rates of clinical relevance, probably results in a reduction in the rate of decline of FEV 1  of uncertain clinical relevance and likely results in a small improvement in health\u2010related quality of life not meeting the threshold for a minimally clinically important difference. These potential benefits should be weighed up against adverse events (likely to increase local oropharyngeal adverse effects and may increase the risk of pneumonia) and probably no reduction in mortality. Though not recommended as monotherapy, the probable benefits of ICS highlighted in this review support their continued consideration in combination with long\u2010acting bronchodilators. Future research and evidence syntheses should be focused in that area. "}

Seven studies are ongoing.  The 12 RCTs randomised 610 women with endometrial cancer who were overweight or obese. All studies compared combined behavioural and lifestyle interventions designed to facilitate weight loss through dietary modification and increased physical activity with usual care. Included RCTs were of low or very low quality, due to high risk of bias by failing to blind participants, personnel and outcome assessors, and significant loss to follow\u2010up (withdrawal rate up to 28% and missing data up to 65%, largely due to the effects of the COVID\u201019 pandemic). Importantly, the short duration of follow\u2010up limits the directness of the evidence in evaluating the impact of these interventions on any of the survival and other longer\u2010term outcomes.  Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with improved overall survival compared with usual care at 24 months (risk ratio (RR) mortality, 0.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 4.55, P = 0.34; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There was no evidence that such interventions were associated with improvements in cancer\u2010specific survival or cardiovascular event frequency as the studies reported no cancer\u2010related deaths, myocardial infarctions or strokes, and there was only one episode of congestive heart failure at six months (RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 82.21; P = 0.44, 5 RCTs, 211 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Only one RCT reported recurrence\u2010free survival; however, there were no events. Combined behaviour and lifestyle interventions were not associated with significant weight loss at either six or 12 months compared with usual care (at six months: mean difference (MD) \u22121.39 kg, 95% CI \u22124.04 to 1.26; P = 0.30, I 2  = 32%; 5 RCTs, 209 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

The trials reported no serious adverse events related to weight loss interventions, for example hospitalisation or deaths. It is uncertain whether lifestyle and behavioural interventions were associated with a higher or lower risk of musculoskeletal symptoms (RR 19.03, 95% CI 1.17 to 310.52; P = 0.04; 8 RCTs, 315 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence; note: 7 studies reported musculoskeletal symptoms but recorded 0 events in both groups.

There is currently insufficient high\u2010quality evidence to determine the effect of combined lifestyle and behavioural interventions on survival, quality of life or significant weight loss in women with a history of endometrial cancer who are overweight or obese compared to those receiving usual care. The limited evidence suggests that there is little or no serious or life\u2010threatening adverse effects due to these interventions, and it is uncertain if musculoskeletal problems were increased, as only one out of eight studies reporting this outcome had any events. Our conclusion is based on low\u2010 and very low\u2010certainty evidence from a small number of trials and few women. Therefore, we have very little confidence in the evidence: the true effect of weight\u2010loss interventions in women with endometrial cancer and obesity is currently unknown. Further methodologically rigorous, adequately powered RCTs are required with follow\u2010up of five to 10 years of duration. These should focus on the effects of varying dietary modification regimens, and pharmacological treatments associated with weight loss and bariatric surgery on survival, quality of life, weight loss and adverse events.

It was not possible to perform a meta\u2010analysis for overall survival and local recurrence free\u2010survival due to clinical heterogeneity across studies and a lack of data to calculate hazard ratios (HR).

We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to the risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency among the studies. There were no data available on the following outcomes: systemic surgical complications, local complications, explantation of implant/expander, hematoma, seroma, rehospitalization, skin necrosis with revisional surgery, and capsular contracture of the implant.

Primary outcomes:  methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher\u2010rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.88 to \u22120.61; I\u00b2 = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of \u221210.58 (95% CI \u221212.58 to \u22128.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD\u2010RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD\u2010RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I\u00b2 = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The TSA\u2010adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68). Secondary outcomes:  methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non\u2010serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I\u00b2 = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The TSA\u2010adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher\u2010rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD \u22120.62, 95% CI \u22120.91 to \u22120.33; I\u00b2 = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.83; I\u00b2 = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta\u2010analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no\u2010intervention may improve teacher\u2010rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non\u2010serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non\u2010serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes. "}

We extracted data from 11 studies. The studies had low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence with evidence downgraded due to inconsistencies in the data and performance bias. The total number of participants in meta\u2010analyses comparing exercise\u2010based rehabilitation to control groups was 462.

Changes in exercise capacity remain heterogeneous and cannot be explained by subgroup analysis. It is likely that exercise\u2010based rehabilitation increases HRQoL and is probably not associated with an increased risk of a serious adverse events. Exercise training may result in a large reduction in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Overall, we assessed the certainty of the evidence to be low for exercise capacity and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and moderate for HRQoL and adverse events. Future RCTs are needed to inform the application of exercise\u2010based rehabilitation across the spectrum of people with PH, including those with chronic thromboembolic PH, PH with left\u2010sided heart disease and those with more severe disease.

Forty\u2010five per cent of participants were women and 55% were men, with a mean age of 56 years (range 48 to 77 years). The mean glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb1Ac) was 8.45% for the PRP group and 8.25% for people receiving anti\u2010VEGFs alone or in combination. Twelve studies included people with PDR, and participants in 11 studies had high\u2010risk PDR (HRPDR). Twelve studies were of bevacizumab, seven of ranibizumab, one of conbercept, two of pegaptanib, and one of aflibercept. The mean number of participants per RCT was 76 (ranging from 15 to 305).

To synthesise the views and experiences of consumers and health providers of formal partnership approaches that aimed to improve planning, delivery or evaluation of health services. 2. To identify best practice principles for formal partnership approaches in health services by understanding consumers' and health providers' views and experiences. \n\nMain results:\n We found 182 studies that were eligible for inclusion. From this group, we selected 33 studies to include in the final synthesis. These studies came from a wide range of countries including 28 from high\u2010income countries and five from low\u2010 or middle\u2010income countries (LMICs). Each of the studies included the experiences and views of consumers and/or health providers of partnering in formal group formats. The results were divided into the following categories. Contextual factors influencing partnerships:  government policy, policy implementation processes and funding, as well as the organisational context of the health service, could facilitate or impede partnering (moderate level of confidence). Consumer recruitment:  consumer recruitment occurred in different ways and consumers managed the recruitment process in a minority of studies only (high level of confidence). Recruiting a range of consumers who were reflective of the clinic's demographic population was considered desirable, particularly by health providers (high level of confidence). Some health providers perceived that individual consumers' experiences were not generalisable to the broader population whereas consumers perceived it could be problematic to aim to represent a broad range of community views (high level of confidence). Partnership dynamics and processes:  positive interpersonal dynamics between health providers and consumers facilitated partnerships (high level of confidence). However, formal meeting formats and lack of clarity about the consumer role could constrain consumers\u2019 involvement (high level of confidence). Health providers\u2019 professional status, technical knowledge and use of jargon were intimidating for some consumers (high level of confidence) and consumers could feel their experiential knowledge was not valued (moderate level of confidence). Consumers could also become frustrated when health providers dominated the meeting agenda (moderate level of confidence) and when they experienced token involvement, such as a lack of decision\u2010making power (high level of confidence) Perceived impacts on partnership participants:  partnering could affect health provider and consumer participants in both positive and negative ways (high level of confidence). Perceived impacts on health service planning, delivery and evaluation:  partnering was perceived to improve the person\u2010centredness of health service culture (high level of confidence), improve the built environment of the health service (high level of confidence), improve health service design and delivery e.g. facilitate 'out of hours' services or treatment closer to home (high level of confidence), enhance community ownership of health services, particularly in LMICs (moderate level of confidence), and improve consumer involvement in strategic decision\u2010making, under certain conditions (moderate level of confidence). There was limited evidence suggesting partnering may improve health service evaluation (very low level of confidence). Best practice principles for formal partnering to promote person\u2010centred care were developed from these findings. The principles were developed collaboratively with the Stakeholder Panel and included leadership and health service culture; diversity; equity; mutual respect; shared vision and regular communication; shared agendas and decision\u2010making; influence and sustainability. ", "conclusion": " Successful formal group partnerships with consumers require health providers to continually reflect and address power imbalances that may constrain consumers' participation. Such imbalances may be particularly acute in recruitment procedures, meeting structure and content and decision\u2010making processes. Formal group partnerships were perceived to improve the physical environment of health services, the person\u2010centredness of health service culture and health service design and delivery. Implementing the best practice principles may help to address power imbalances, strengthen formal partnering, improve the experiences of consumers and health providers and positively affect partnership outcomes.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD006499.pub5", "abstract": "Objectives:\n The primary objective was to examine the efficacy of botulinum toxin therapy in the treatment of strabismus compared with alternative conservative or surgical treatment options. This review sought to ascertain those types of strabismus that particularly benefit from the use of botulinum toxin as a treatment option (such as small angle strabismus or strabismus with binocular potential, i.e. the potential to use both eyes together as a pair). The secondary objectives were to investigate the dose effect and complication rates associated with botulinum toxin. \n\nMain results:\n We included four RCTs with 242 participants that enrolled adults with esotropia or exotropia, children with acquired esotropia, and children with infantile esotropia. The follow\u2010up period ranged from six to 36 months. Two studies were conducted in Spain, and one each in Canada and South Africa. We judged the included studies to have a mixture of low, unclear and high risk of bias. We did not consider any of the included studies to be at low risk of bias for all domains. All four studies reported the proportion of participants who improved or corrected strabismus, defined as \u2264 10 prism diopters (PD) at six months (two studies) or \u2264 8 PD at one year (two studies). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggested that participants treated with the surgery may be more likely to improve or correct strabismus compared with those who treated with botulinum toxin (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.99; I\u00b2 = 50%; 4 studies, 242 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). One study, which enrolled 110 children with infantile esotropia, suggested that surgery may reduce the incidence of additional surgical intervention required, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 3.05, 95% CI 1.34 to 6.91; 1 study, 101 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies conducted in Spain compared botulinum toxin with surgery in children who required retreatment for acquired or infantile esotropia. These two studies provided low\u2010certainty evidence that botulinum toxin may have little to no effect on achieving sensory fusion (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.23; I\u00b2 = 0%; 2 studies, 102 participants) and stereopsis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.25; I\u00b2 = 0%; 2 studies, 102 participants) compared with surgery. Three studies reported non\u2010serious adverse events. Partial transient ptosis (range 16.7% to 37.0%) and transient vertical deviation (range 5.6% to 18.5%) were observed among participants treated with botulinum toxin in three studies. In one study, 44.7% participants in the surgery group experienced discomfort. No studies reported serious adverse events or postintervention quality of life. ", "conclusion": " It remains unclear whether botulinum toxin may be an alternative to strabismus surgery as an independent treatment modality among certain types of strabismus because we found only low and very low\u2010certainty evidence in this review update. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that strabismus surgery may be preferable to botulinum toxin injection to improve or correct strabismus when types of strabismus and different age groups are combined. We found low\u2010certainty evidence suggesting botulinum toxin may have little to no effect on achievement of binocular single vision compared with surgery in children with acquired or infantile esotropia. We did not find sufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions with respect to need for additional surgery, quality of life, and serious adverse events. We identified three ongoing trials comparing botulinum toxin with conventional surgeries in the varying types of strabismus, whose results will provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty.

The eight studies included 961 participants with glaucoma, and compared two types of devices implanted during trabeculectomy versus standard trabeculectomy. Seven studies (462 eyes, 434 participants) used the Ex\u2010PRESS, and one study (527 eyes, 527 participants) used the PreserFlo MicroShunt. No studies using the XEN Gel Stent implantation met our criteria. The studies were conducted in North America, Europe, and Africa. Planned follow\u2010up periods ranged from six months to five years. The studies were reported poorly, which limited our ability to judge risk of bias for many domains. None of the studies explicitly masked outcome assessment. We rated seven studies at high risk of detection bias. Low\u2010certainty of evidence from five studies showed that using the Ex\u2010PRESS plus trabeculectomy compared with standard trabeculectomy may be associated with a slightly lower IOP at one year (mean difference (MD) \u22121.76 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22122.81 to \u22120.70; 213 eyes).

Two studies assessed adverse effects, but no adverse effects were observed. We are very uncertain about the effects of personally tailored activities on mood and positive affect. For negative affect we found moderate\u2010certainty evidence that there is probably little to no effect of personally tailored activities compared to usual care or activities which are not personalised (standardised mean difference \u20100.02, 95% CI \u22120.19 to 0.14; 6 studies, 632 participants). We were not able to undertake meta\u2010analyses for engagement and sleep\u2010related outcomes, and we are very uncertain whether personally tailored activities have any effect on these outcomes. Two studies that investigated the duration of the effects of personally tailored activities indicated that the intervention effects they found persisted only during the period of delivery of the activities. ", "conclusion": " Offering personally tailored activities to people with dementia in long\u2010term care may slightly reduce agitation. Personally tailored activities may result in little to no difference in quality of life rated by proxies, but we acknowledge concerns about the validity of proxy ratings of quality of life in severe dementia. Personally tailored activities probably have little or no effect on negative affect, and we are uncertain whether they have any effect on positive affect or mood. There was no evidence that interventions were more likely to be effective if based on one theoretical model rather than another. We included three new studies in this updated review, but two studies were pilot trials and included only a small number of participants. Certainty of evidence was predominately very low or low due to several methodological limitations of and inconsistencies between the included studies. Evidence is still limited, and we remain unable to describe optimal activity programmes. Further research should focus on methods for selecting appropriate and meaningful activities for people in different stages of dementia. "}

Two trials investigated multiple regimens, and were therefore included in more than one comparison. Only RCTs investigating dexamethasone were identified. Eight studies enrolling a total of 306 participants investigated the cumulative dosage administered; these trials were categorized according to the cumulative dosage investigated, 'low' being < 2 mg/kg, 'moderate' being between 2 and 4 mg/kg, and 'high' > 4 mg/kg; three studies contrasted a high versus a moderate cumulative dose, and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dexamethasone dose. We graded the certainty of the evidence low to very low because of the small number of events, and the risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias. Overall analysis of the studies investigating a higher dose versus a lower dosage regimen showed no differences in the outcomes BPD, the composite outcome death or BPD at 36 weeks' PMA, or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome in survivors assessed. Although there was no evidence of a subgroup difference for the higher versus lower dosage regimens comparisons (Chi 2  = 2.91, df = 1 (P = 0.09), I 2  = 65.7%), a larger effect was seen in the subgroup analysis of moderate\u2010dosage regimens versus high\u2010dosage regimens for the outcome cerebral palsy in survivors. In this subgroup analysis, there was an increased risk of cerebral palsy (RR 6.85, 95% CI 1.29 to 36.36; RD 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.37; P = 0.02; I\u00b2 = 0%; NNTH 5, 95% CI 2.6 to 12.7; 2 studies, 74 infants). There was evidence of subgroup differences for higher versus lower dosage regimens comparisons for the combined outcomes death or cerebral palsy, and death and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes (Chi 2  = 4.25, df = 1 (P = 0.04), I 2  = 76.5%; and Chi 2  = 7.11, df = 1 (P = 0.008), I 2  = 85.9%, respectively). In the subgroup analysis comparing a high dosage regimen of dexamethasone versus a moderate cumulative\u2010dosage regimen, there was an increased risk of death or cerebral palsy (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.35 to 7.58; RD 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.41; P = 0.002; I\u00b2 = 0%; NNTH 5, 95% CI 2.4 to 13.6; 2 studies, 84 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and death or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome (RR 3.41, 95% CI 1.44 to 8.07; RD 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.44; P = 0.0009; I\u00b2 = 0%; NNTH 4, 95% CI 2.2 to 10.4; 2 studies, 84 infants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There were no differences in outcomes between a moderate\u2010 and a low\u2010dosage regimen. Five studies enrolling 797 infants investigated early initiation of dexamethasone therapy versus a moderately early or delayed initiation, and showed no significant differences in the overall analyses for the primary outcomes. The two RCTs investigating a continuous versus a pulse dexamethasone regimen showed an increased risk of the combined outcome death or BPD when using the pulse therapy. Finally, three trials investigating a standard regimen versus a participant\u2010individualized course of dexamethasone showed no difference in the primary outcome and long\u2010term neurodevelopmental outcomes. We assessed the GRADE certainty of evidence for all comparisons discussed above as moderate to very low, because the validity of all comparisons is hampered by unclear or high risk of bias, small samples of randomized infants, heterogeneity in study population and design, non\u2010protocolized use of \u2018rescue\u2019 corticosteroids and lack of long\u2010term neurodevelopmental data in most studies. ", "conclusion": " The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of different corticosteroid regimens on the outcomes mortality, pulmonary morbidity, and long term neurodevelopmental impairment. Despite the fact that the studies investigating higher versus lower dosage regimens showed that higher\u2010dosage regimens may reduce the incidence of death or neurodevelopmental impairment, we cannot conclude what the optimal type, dosage, or timing of initiation is for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants, based on current level of evidence. Further high quality trials would be needed to establish the optimal systemic postnatal corticosteroid dosage regimen. "}

We excluded 5324 records and the remaining 121 references were assessed for eligibility. We included three two\u2010arm RCTs with 130 participants. Cancer types were breast and prostate cancer. Both treatment groups received the same standard care, but the exercise groups also participated in supervised exercise programmes several times per week while undergoing RT. Exercise interventions included warm\u2010up, treadmill walking (in addition to cycling and stretching and strengthening exercises in one study), and cool\u2010down. In some analysed endpoints (fatigue, physical performance, QoL), there were baseline differences between exercise and control groups. We were unable to pool the results of the different studies owing to substantial clinical heterogeneity. All three studies measured fatigue. Our analyses, presented below, showed that exercise may reduce fatigue (positive SMD values signify less fatigue; low certainty). \u2022 Standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.64; 37 participants (fatigue measured with Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI))\u2028\u2022 SMD 2.42, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.13; 54 participants (fatigue measured with BFI)\u2028\u2022 SMD 1.44, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.42; 21 participants (fatigue measured with revised Piper Fatigue Scale) All three studies measured QoL, although one provided insufficient data for analysis.

No studies reported the other outcomes we intended to analyse (overall survival, anthropometric measurements, return to work). ", "conclusion": " There is little evidence on the effects of exercise interventions in people with cancer who are receiving RT alone. While all included studies reported benefits for the exercise intervention groups in all assessed outcomes, our analyses did not consistently support this evidence. There was low\u2010certainty evidence that exercise improved fatigue in all three studies. Regarding physical performance, our analysis showed very low\u2010certainty evidence of a difference favouring exercise in two studies, and very low\u2010certainty evidence of no difference in one study. We found very low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference between the effects of exercise and no exercise on quality of life or psychosocial effects. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for possible outcome reporting bias, imprecision due to small sample sizes in a small number of studies, and indirectness of outcomes. In summary, exercise may have some beneficial outcomes in people with cancer who are receiving RT alone, but the evidence supporting this statement is of low certainty.

Participants were on average 59.3 years old; 71.0% were male; and 72.9% and 27.4% had paroxysmal and persistent AF, respectively. Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may reduce recurrence of ATa at 0 to 3 months postablation (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.94, 8 trials, 3046 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence) and likely reduce recurrence at > 3 to 6 months, our a priori primary time point (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, 5 trials, 2591 participants, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Beyond six months the evidence is very uncertain, and the benefit of antiarrhythmics may not persist (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.55, 4 trials, 2244 participants, very low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that Class I and/or III antiarrhythmics may not increase the risk of thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, all\u2010cause mortality, or requirement for repeat ablation, at 0 to 3, > 3 to 6, and > 6 months (where data were available; low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence).

No data were available beyond three months. No data were available on new diagnoses of heart failure. Fewer data were available for Class I and III antiarrhythmics individually.

No data were available for thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, new diagnosis of heart failure, or all\u2010cause mortality at any time points, or hospitalisation or repeat ablation beyond three months. Class III antiarrhythmics may have little effect on recurrence of ATa at up to 3 months and at > 3 to 6 months (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.16, 4 trials, 599 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09, 2 trials, 318 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence), and beyond 6 months one trial reported a possible increase in recurrence of ATa (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.94, 1 trial, 112 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Class III antiarrhythmics likely reduce hospitalisations for ATa at 0 to 3 months (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63, moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and may have little effect on all\u2010cause mortality (low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence). The effect of Class III antiarrhythmics on thromboembolic events and requirement for repeat ablation was uncertain (very low\u2010certainty evidence for both outcomes). No data were available for myocardial infarction or new diagnosis of heart failure at any time point, outcomes other than recurrence beyond 6 months, or for hospitalisation and repeat ablation > 3 to 6 months.

A total of 8805 participants were randomized. All treatments were topical in the form of drops or ointment. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their eligibility criteria, the nature of the intervention (antibiotic drug class, which included fluoroquinolones [FQs] and non\u2010FQs; dosage frequency; duration of treatment), the outcomes assessed and the time points of assessment. We judged one trial to be of high risk of bias, four as low risk of bias, and the others as raising some concerns. Based on intention\u2010to\u2010treat (ITT) population, antibiotics likely improved clinical cure (resolution of clinical symptoms or signs) by 26% (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.46; 5 trials, 1474 participants; moderate certainty) as compared with placebo. Subgroup analysis showed no differences by antibiotic class (P = 0.67) or treatment duration (P = 0.60). In the placebo group, 55.5% (408/735) of participants had spontaneous clinical resolution by days 4 to 9 versus 68.2% (504/739) of participants treated with an antibiotic. Based on modified ITT population, in which participants were analyzed after randomization on the basis of positive microbiological culture, antibiotics likely increased microbiological cure (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 10 trials, 2827 participants) compared with placebo at the end of therapy; there were no subgroup differences by drug class (P = 0.60). No study evaluated the cost\u2010effectiveness of antibiotic treatment. Patients receiving antibiotics had a lower risk of treatment incompletion than those in the placebo group (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.78; 13 trials, 5573 participants; moderate certainty) and were 27% less likely to have persistent clinical infection (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.81; 19 trials, 5280 participants; moderate certainty). There was no evidence of serious systemic side effects reported in either the antibiotic or placebo group (very low certainty). When compared with placebo, FQs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90) but not non\u2010FQs (RR 4.05, 95% CI 1.36 to 12.00) may result in fewer participants with ocular side effects. However, the estimated effects were of very low certainty. ", "conclusion": " The findings of this update suggest that the use of topical antibiotics is associated with a modestly improved chance of resolution in comparison to the use of placebo. Since no evidence of serious side effects was reported, use of antibiotics may therefore be considered to achieve better clinical and microbiologic efficacy than placebo. Increasing the proportion of participants with clinical cure or increasing the speed of recovery or both are important for individual return to work or school, allowing people to regain quality of life. Future studies may examine antiseptic treatments with topical antibiotics for reasons of cost and growing antibiotic resistance.   "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD005431.pub5", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the effectiveness of various medical interventions in the management of traumatic hyphema. \n\nMain results:\n We included 23 randomized and seven quasi\u2010randomized studies with a total of 2969 participants. Interventions included antifibrinolytic agents (systemic and topical aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and aminomethylbenzoic acid), corticosteroids (systemic and topical), cycloplegics, miotics, aspirin, conjugated estrogens, traditional Chinese medicine, monocular versus bilateral patching, elevation of the head, and bed rest. We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity for any intervention, whether measured within two weeks (short term) or for longer periods. In a meta\u2010analysis of two trials, we found no evidence of an effect of aminocaproic acid on long\u2010term visual acuity (RR 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.29) or final visual acuity measured up to three years after the hyphema (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18). Oral tranexamic acid appeared to provide little to no benefit on visual acuity in four trials (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.25). The remaining trials evaluated the effects of various interventions on short\u2010term visual acuity; none of these interventions was measured in more than one trial. No intervention showed a statistically significant effect (RRs ranged from 0.75 to 1.10). Similarly, visual acuity measured for longer periods in four trials evaluating different interventions was also not statistically significant (RRs ranged from 0.82 to 1.02). The evidence supporting these findings was of low or very low certainty. Systemic aminocaproic acid reduced the rate of recurrent hemorrhage (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60), as assessed in six trials with 330 participants. A sensitivity analysis omitting two studies not using an intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis reduced the strength of the evidence (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.08). We obtained similar results for topical aminocaproic acid (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10) in two trials with 131 participants. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as low. Systemic tranexamic acid had a significant effect in reducing the rate of secondary hemorrhage (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.53) in seven trials with 754 participants, as did aminomethylbenzoic acid (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.41), as reported in one study. Evidence to support an associated reduction in risk of complications from secondary hemorrhage (i.e. corneal blood staining, peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, and development of optic atrophy) by antifibrinolytics was limited by the small number of these events. Use of aminocaproic acid was associated with increased nausea, vomiting, and other adverse events compared with placebo. We found no evidence of an effect on the number of adverse events with the use of systemic versus topical aminocaproic acid or with standard versus lower drug dose.  The number of days for the primary hyphema to resolve appeared to be longer with the use of systemic aminocaproic acid compared with no use, but this outcome was not altered by any other intervention. The available evidence on usage of systemic or topical corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or aspirin in traumatic hyphema was limited due to the small numbers of participants and events in the trials. We found no evidence of an effect between a single versus binocular patch on the risk of secondary hemorrhage or time to rebleed. We also found no evidence of an effect on the risk of secondary hemorrhage between ambulation and complete bed rest. ", "conclusion": " We found no evidence of an effect on visual acuity of any of the interventions evaluated in this review. Although the evidence was limited, people with traumatic hyphema who receive aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid are less likely to experience secondary hemorrhage. However, hyphema took longer to clear in people treated with systemic aminocaproic acid. There is no good evidence to support the use of antifibrinolytic agents in the management of traumatic hyphema, other than possibly to reduce the rate of secondary hemorrhage. The potentially long\u2010term deleterious effects of secondary hemorrhage are unknown. Similarly, there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids, cycloplegics, or non\u2010drug interventions (such as patching, bed rest, or head elevation) in the management of traumatic hyphema. As these multiple interventions are rarely used in isolation, further research to assess the additive effect of these interventions might be of value. "}

Participants were on average 78 years old, and 65% were women. For fall outcomes, five studies had high risk of bias and most studies had unclear risk of bias for one or more risk of bias domains. For other outcomes (e.g. fractures), most studies were at high risk of detection bias. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for high risk of bias, imprecision, and/or inconsistency.  Home fall\u2010hazard reduction (14 studies, 5830 participants) These interventions aim to reduce falls by assessing fall hazards and making environmental safety adaptations (e.g. non\u2010slip strips on steps) or behavioural strategies (e.g. avoiding clutter).

The evidence for number of fallers requiring medical attention was unclear (2 studies, 216 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies reported no adverse events. Assistive technology Vision improvement interventions may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 1.12, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.50; 3 studies, 1489 participants) or people experiencing one or more falls (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) (low\u2010certainty evidence). We are unsure of the evidence for fall\u2010related fractures (2 studies, 976 participants) and falls requiring medical attention (1 study, 276 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There may be little or no difference in HRQoL (mean difference 0.40, 95% CI \u22121.12 to 1.92) or adverse events (falls while switching glasses; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.02) (1 study, 597 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Results for other assistive technology \u2010 footwear and foot devices, and self\u2010care and assistive devices (5 studies, 651 participants) \u2010 were not pooled due to the diversity of interventions and contexts.  Education  We are uncertain whether an education intervention to reduce home fall hazards reduces the rate of falls or the number of people experiencing one or more falls (1 study; very low\u2010certainty evidence). These interventions may make little or no difference to the risk of fall\u2010related fractures (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 1 study, 110 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  Home modifications We found no trials of home modifications that measured falls as an outcome for task enablement and functional independence. ", "conclusion": " We found high\u2010certainty evidence that home fall\u2010hazard interventions are effective in reducing the rate of falls and the number of fallers when targeted to people at higher risk of falling, such as having had a fall in the past year and recently hospitalised or needing support with daily activities. There was evidence of no effect when interventions were targeted to people not selected for risk of falling. Further research is needed to examine the impact of intervention components, the effect of awareness raising, and participant\u2010interventionist engagement on decision\u2010making and adherence.  Vision improvement interventions may or may not impact the rate of falls. Further research is needed to answer clinical questions such as whether people should be given advice or take additional precautions when changing eye prescriptions, or whether the intervention is more effective when targeting people at higher risk of falls. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether education interventions impact falls. "}

Follow\u2010up duration varied from six months to 24 months. Of the 223 participants (37 men) randomised to surgery, 164 were included in the analyses, of whom 163 were cured at six to 24 months (overall cure rate 99%). Parathyroidectomy compared to observation probably results in a large increase in cure rate at six to 24 months follow\u2010up: 163/164 participants (99.4%) in the parathyroidectomy group and 0/169 participants in the observation or medical therapy group were cured of their PHPT (8 studies, 333 participants; moderate certainty).  No studies explicitly reported intervention effects on morbidities related to PHPT, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, kidney dysfunction, urolithiasis, cognitive dysfunction or cardiovascular disease, although some studies reported surrogate outcomes for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. A post\u2010hoc analysis revealed that parathyroidectomy, compared to observation or medical therapy, may have little or no effect after one to two years on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 0.03 g/cm 2 ,95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.12; 5 studies, 287 participants; very low certainty). Similarly, compared to observation, parathyroidectomy may have little or no effect on femoral neck BMD after one to two years (MD \u22120.01 g/cm 2 , 95% CI \u22120.13 to 0.11; 3 studies, 216 participants; very low certainty). However, the evidence is very uncertain for both BMD outcomes. Furthermore, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on improving left ventricular ejection fraction (MD \u22122.38%, 95% CI \u22124.77 to 0.01; 3 studies, 121 participants; very low certainty). Four studies reported serious adverse events. Three of these reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups; consequently, we were unable to include data from these three studies in the pooled analysis. The evidence suggests that parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 78.60; 4 studies, 168 participants; low certainty).  Only two studies reported all\u2010cause mortality. One study could not be included in the pooled analysis as zero events were observed in both the intervention and control groups. Parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on all\u2010cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.20 to 22.60; 2 studies, 133 participants; very low certainty). Three studies measured health\u2010related quality of life using the 36\u2010Item Short Form Health Survey (SF\u201036) and reported inconsistent differences in scores for different domains of the questionnaire between parathyroidectomy and observation. Six studies reported hospitalisations for the correction of hypercalcaemia. Two studies reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups and could not be included in the pooled analysis. Parathyroidectomy, compared to observation, may have little or no effect on hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.25; 6 studies, 287 participants; low certainty). There were no reported hospitalisations for renal impairment or pancreatitis. ", "conclusion": " In accordance with the literature, our review findings suggest that parathyroidectomy, compared to simple observation or medical (etidronate) therapy, probably results in a large increase in cure rates of PHPT (with normalisation of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels to laboratory reference values). Parathyroidectomy, compared with observation, may have little or no effect on serious adverse events or hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on other short\u2010term outcomes, such as BMD, all\u2010cause mortality and quality of life. The high uncertainty of evidence limits the applicability of our findings to clinical practice; indeed, this systematic review provides no new insights with regard to treatment decisions for people with (asymptomatic) PHPT. In addition, the methodological limitations of the included studies, and the characteristics of the study populations (mainly comprising white women with asymptomatic PHPT), warrant caution when extrapolating the results to other populations with PHPT. Large\u2010scale multi\u2010national, multi\u2010ethnic and long\u2010term RCTs are needed to explore the potential short\u2010 and long\u2010term benefits of parathyroidectomy compared to non\u2010surgical treatment options with regard to osteoporosis or osteopenia, urolithiasis, hospitalisation for acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease and quality of life.

As women and healthcare practitioners may be aware of evidence from observational studies, and as the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics and the International Confederation of Midwives collaboratively conclude that there is strong evidence that out\u2010of\u2010hospital birth supported by a registered midwife is safe, equipoise may no longer exist, and randomised trials may now thus be considered unethical or hardly feasible.

It was not possible to blind women and staff to the intervention, but for other 'Risk of bias' domains these studies were assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias. Compared to expectant management, there was no clear effect of induction of labour for suspected macrosomia on the risk of  caesarean section  (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.09; 1190 women; four trials,  moderate\u2010quality evidence ) or  instrumental delivery  (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.13; 1190 women; four trials,  low\u2010quality evidence ).

For outcomes assessed using GRADE, we based our downgrading decisions on high risk of bias from lack of blinding and imprecision of effect estimates. ", "conclusion": " Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia has not been shown to alter the risk of brachial plexus injury, but the power of the included studies to show a difference for such a rare event is limited. Also antenatal estimates of fetal weight are often inaccurate so many women may be worried unnecessarily, and many inductions may not be needed. Nevertheless, induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia results in a lower mean birthweight, and fewer birth fractures and shoulder dystocia. The observation of increased use of phototherapy in the largest trial, should also be kept in mind. Findings from trials included in the review suggest that to prevent one fracture it would be necessary to induce labour in 60 women. Since induction of labour does not appear to alter the rate of caesarean delivery or instrumental delivery, it is likely to be popular with many women. In settings where obstetricians can be reasonably confident about their scan assessment of fetal weight, the advantages and disadvantages of induction at or near term for fetuses suspected of being macrosomic should be discussed with parents. Although some parents and doctors may feel the evidence already justifies induction, others may justifiably disagree. Further trials of induction shortly before term for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed. Such trials should concentrate on refining the optimum gestation of induction, and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of macrosomia. "}

Ten cross\u2010over trials compared SCS with placebo. Three parallel\u2010group trials assessed the addition of SCS to medical management. Most studies were at risk of performance and detection bias from inadequate blinding and selective reporting bias. The placebo\u2010controlled trials had other important biases, including lack of accounting for period and carryover effects. Two of the three parallel trials assessing SCS as an addition to medical management were at risk of attrition bias, and all three had substantial cross\u2010over to the SCS group for time points beyond six months. In the parallel\u2010group trials, we considered the lack of placebo control to be an important source of bias. None of our included studies evaluated the impact of SCS on mean low back pain intensity in the long term (\u2265 12 months). The studies most often assessed outcomes in the immediate term (less than one month). At six months, the only available evidence was from a single cross\u2010over trial (50 participants). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence that SCS probably does not improve back or leg pain, function, or quality of life compared with placebo. Pain was 61 points (on a 0\u2010 to 100\u2010point scale, 0 = no pain) at six months with placebo, and 4 points better (8.2 points better to 0.2 points worse) with SCS. Function was 35.4 points (on a 0\u2010 to 100\u2010point scale, 0 = no disability or best function) at six months with placebo, and 1.3 points better (3.9 points better to 1.3 points worse) with SCS. Health\u2010related quality of life was 0.44 points out of 1 (0 to 1 index, 0 = worst quality of life) at six months with placebo, and 0.04 points better (0.16 points better to 0.08 points worse) with SCS. In that same study, nine participants (18%) experienced adverse events and four (8%) required revision surgery. Serious adverse events with SCS included infections, neurological damage, and lead migration requiring repeated surgery. We could not provide effect estimates of the relative risks as events were not reported for the placebo period. In parallel trials assessing SCS as an addition to medical management, it is uncertain whether, in the medium or long term, SCS can reduce low back pain, leg pain, or health\u2010related quality of life, or if it increases the number of people reporting a 50% improvement or better, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that adding SCS to medical management may slightly improve function and slightly reduce opioid use. In the medium term, mean function (0\u2010 to 100\u2010point scale; lower is better) was 16.2 points better with the addition of SCS to medical management compared with medical management alone (95% confidence interval (CI) 19.4 points better to 13.0 points better; I 2  = 95%; 3 studies, 430 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

Adverse events with SCS were poorly reported but included infection and lead migration. One study found that, at 24 months, 13 of 42 people (31%) receiving SCS required revision surgery. It is uncertain to what extent the addition of SCS to medical management increases the risk of withdrawals due to adverse events, adverse events, or serious adverse events, because the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Meta\u2010regression found no statistically significant association with adequacy of the active placebo or risk of unintended therapeutic effect. ", "conclusion": " We did not find a statistically significant difference between active and standard placebo control interventions in our primary analysis, but the result was imprecise and the CI compatible with a difference ranging from important to irrelevant. Furthermore, the result was not robust, because two sensitivity analyses produced a more pronounced and statistically significant difference. We suggest that trialists and users of information from trials carefully consider the type of placebo control intervention in trials with high risk of unblinding, such as those with pronounced non\u2010therapeutic effects and participant\u2010reported outcomes.

One trial assessed medication management, one assessed an education intervention (NRSI) and 18 RCTs were of medication interventions. Medications assessed were subcutaneous deferoxamine, and two oral chelating agents, deferiprone and deferasirox. We rated the certainty of evidence as very low to low across all outcomes identified in this review. Four trials measured quality of life (QoL) with validated instruments, but provided no analysable data and reported no difference in QoL. We identified nine comparisons of interest. 1. Deferiprone versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferiprone affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (four RCTs, unpooled, very low\u2010certainty evidence), all\u2010cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.21; 3 RCTs, 376 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (SAEs) (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.46; 1 RCT, 228 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  Adherence was reported as \"good\", \"high\" or \"excellent\" by all seven trials, though the data could not be analysed formally: adherence ranged from 69% to 95% (deferiprone, mean 86.6%), and 71% to 93% (deferoxamine, mean 78.8%), based on five trials (474 participants) only. 2. Deferasirox versus deferoxamine We are uncertain whether or not deferasirox affects adherence to iron chelation therapy (three RCTs, unpooled, very low\u2010certainty evidence), although medication adherence was high in all trials. We are uncertain whether or not there is any difference between the drug therapies in serious adverse events (SAEs) (SCD or thalassaemia) or all\u2010cause mortality (thalassaemia). 3. Deferiprone versus deferasirox We are uncertain if there is a difference between oral deferiprone and deferasirox based on a single trial in children (average age 9 to 10 years) with any hereditary haemoglobinopathy in adherence, SAEs and all\u2010cause mortality. 4. Deferasirox film\u2010coated tablet (FCT) versus deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT) One RCT compared deferasirox in different tablet forms. There may be a preference for FCTs, shown through a trend for greater adherence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 88 participants), although medication adherence was high in both groups (FCT 92.9%; DT 85.3%). We are uncertain if there is a benefit in chelation\u2010related AEs with FCTs. We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs, all\u2010cause mortality or sustained adherence. 5. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence, though reporting was usually narrative as triallists report it was \"excellent\" in both groups (three RCTs, unpooled). We are uncertain if there is a difference in the incidence of SAEs and all\u2010cause mortality.  6. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferoxamine alone We are uncertain if there is a difference in adherence (four RCTs), SAEs (none reported in the trial period) and all\u2010cause mortality (no deaths reported in the trial period). There was high adherence in all trials. 7. Deferiprone and deferoxamine combined versus deferiprone and deferasirox combined There may be a difference in favour of deferiprone and deferasirox (combined) in rates of adherence (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99) (one RCT), although it was high (> 80%) in both groups. We are uncertain if there is a difference in SAEs, and no deaths were reported in the trial, so we cannot draw conclusions based on these data (one RCT). 8. Medication management versus standard care We are uncertain if there is a difference in QoL (one RCT), and we could not assess adherence due to a lack of reporting in the control group. 9. Education versus standard care One quasi\u2010experimental (NRSI) study could not be analysed due to the severe baseline confounding. ", "conclusion": " The medication comparisons included in this review had higher than average adherence rates not accounted for by differences in medication administration or side effects, though often follow\u2010up was not good (high dropout over longer trials), with adherence based on a per protocol analysis. Participants may have been selected based on higher adherence to trial medications at baseline. Also, within the clinical trial context, there is increased attention and involvement of clinicians, thus high adherence rates may be an artefact of trial participation. Real\u2010world, pragmatic trials in community and clinic settings are needed that examine both confirmed or unconfirmed adherence strategies that may increase adherence to iron chelation therapy. Due to lack of evidence this review cannot comment on intervention strategies for different age groups. "}

Twenty studies tested LIPUS and one trial tested ECSW; no studies tested HIFUS. Four studies did not report any of the critical outcomes. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. LIPUS versus control (20 studies, 1459 participants) We found very low\u2010certainty evidence for the effect of LIPUS on Health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL) measured by SF\u201036 at up to one year after surgery for lower limb fractures (mean difference (MD) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20103.85 to 3.97, favours LIPUS; 3 studies, 393 participants). This result was compatible with a clinically important difference of 3 units with both LIPUS or control. There may be little to no difference in time to return to work after people had complete fractures of the upper or lower limbs (MD 1.96 days, 95% CI \u20102.13 to 6.04, favours control; 2 studies, 370 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).  There is probably little or no difference in delayed union or non\u2010union up to 12 months after surgery (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.09, favours control; 7 studies, 746 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Although data for delayed and non\u2010union included both upper and lower limbs, we noted that there were no incidences of delayed or non\u2010union in upper limb fractures. We did not pool data for time to fracture union (11 studies, 887 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) because of substantial statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain. In upper limb fractures, MDs ranged from 0.32 to 40 fewer days to fracture union with LIPUS. In lower limb fractures, MDs ranged from 88 fewer days to 30 more days to fracture union. We also did not pool data for pain experienced at one month after surgery in people with upper limb fractures (2 studies, 148 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) because of substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity. Using a 10\u2010point visual analogue scale, one study reported less pain with LIPUS (MD \u20101.7, 95% CI \u20103.03 to \u20100.37; 47 participants), and the effect was less precise in the other study (MD \u20100.4, 95% CI \u20100.61 to 0.53; 101 participants). We found little or no difference in skin irritation (a possible treatment\u2010related adverse event) between groups but judged the certainty of the evidence from this small study to be very low (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.65; 1 study, 101 participants). No studies reported data for functional recovery. Data for treatment adherence were inconsistently reported across studies, but was generally described to be good. Data for costs were reported for one study, with higher direct costs, as well as combined direct and indirect costs, for LIPUS use. ECSW versus control (1 study, 56 participants) We are uncertain whether ECSW reduces pain at 12 months after surgery in fractures of the lower limb (MD \u20100.62, 95% CI \u20100.97 to \u20100.27, favours ECSW); the difference between pain scores was unlikely to be clinically important, and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are also uncertain of the effect of ECSW on delayed or non\u2010union at 12 months because the certainty of this evidence is very low (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.01; 1 study, 57 participants). There were no treatment\u2010related adverse events. This study reported no data for HRQoL, functional recovery, time to return to normal activities, or time to fracture union. In addition, no data were available for adherence or cost. ", "conclusion": " We were uncertain of the effectiveness of ultrasound and shock wave therapy for acute fractures in terms of patient\u2010reported outcome measures (PROMS), for which few studies reported data. It is probable that LIPUS makes little or no difference to delayed union or non\u2010union. Future trials should be double\u2010blind, randomised, placebo\u2010controlled trials recording validated PROMs and following up all trial participants. Whilst time to union is difficult to measure, the proportion of participants achieving clinical and radiographic union at each follow\u2010up point should be ascertained, alongside adherence with the study protocol and cost of treatment in order to better inform clinical practice.

Eight RCTs compared ultrasound with palpation, and one compared ultrasound with Doppler auditory assistance. Five studies reported the incidence of haematomas. Seven involved radial artery cannulation and two involved femoral artery cannulation. The people performing arterial cannulation were physicians with different levels of experience. The risk of bias varied across studies, with some studies lacking details of allocation concealment. It was not possible to blind practitioners in any case; this adds a performance bias that is inherent to the type of intervention studied in our review. Compared to traditional methods, ultrasound guidance probably causes a large increase in first\u2010attempt success rates (risk ratio (RR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.46; 8 RCTs, 708 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and probably causes a large reduction in the risk of complications such as haematoma formation (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.47; 5 RCTs, 420 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

Both the included parallel RCTs compared ataluren to placebo for 48 weeks in 517 participants (males and females; age range six to 53 years) with CF who had at least one nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation). The certainty of evidence and risk of bias assessments for the trials were moderate overall. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well documented; participant blinding was less clear. Some participant data were excluded from the analysis in one trial that also had a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. PTC Therapeutics Incorporated sponsored both trials with grant support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health. The trials reported no difference between treatment groups in terms of quality of life, and no improvement in respiratory function measures.

Nine studies reported complete outcome data (attrition bias), while 10 studies reported expected outcomes, so were at low risk of reporting bias. Five studies were at low risk of other bias. Eleven studies evaluated therapy to prevent persistent kidney disease in IgAV with or without kidney involvement at presentation. There was probably no difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease any time after treatment (5 studies, 746 children: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32) or at one, three, six and 12 months in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of IgAV compared with placebo or supportive treatment (moderate certainty evidence). There may be no differences in the risk of any persistent kidney disease with antiplatelet therapy (three studies) or heparin (two studies) in children with or without any kidney disease at study entry, although heparin may reduce the risk of proteinuria by three months compared with placebo or no specific treatment (2 studies, 317 children: RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73). One study comparing montelukast with placebo found no differences in outcomes as assessed by severity scale scores. Nine studies examined the treatment of severe IgAV\u2010associated kidney disease. In two studies (one involving 56 children and the other involving 54 adults), there may be no differences in efficacy outcomes or adverse effects with cyclophosphamide compared with placebo or supportive treatment. In two studies, there may be no differences in the numbers achieving remission of proteinuria with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (65 children evaluated) or tacrolimus (142 children evaluated). In three small studies comparing cyclosporin with methylprednisolone (15 children), MMF with azathioprine (26 children), or MMF with leflunomide (19 children), it is unclear whether the treatment had any effect on the numbers in remission or the degree of proteinuria between treatment groups because of small numbers of included participants. In one study comparing plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone with cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone, there may be no difference in the numbers achieving remission. One study compared fosinopril with no specific therapy and reported fosinopril reduced the number of participants with proteinuria. No studies were identified that evaluated the efficacy of therapy on kidney disease in participants with recurrent episodes of IgAV. ", "conclusion": " There are no substantial changes in conclusions from this update compared with the initial review or the previous update despite the addition of five studies. From generally low to moderate certainty evidence, we found that there may be little or no benefit in the use of corticosteroids or antiplatelet agents to prevent persistent kidney disease in children with IgAV in participants with no or minimal kidney involvement at presentation. We did not find any studies which evaluated corticosteroids in children presenting with IgAV and nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome, although corticosteroids are recommended in such children in guidelines. Though heparin may be effective in reducing proteinuria, this potentially dangerous therapy is not justified to prevent serious kidney disease when few children with IgAV develop severe kidney disease. There may be no benefit of cyclophosphamide compared with no specific treatment or corticosteroids. While there may be no benefit in the efficacy of MMF or tacrolimus compared with IV cyclophosphamide in children or adults with IgAV and severe kidney disease, adverse effects, particularly infections, may be lower in MMF or tacrolimus\u2010treated children. Because of small patient numbers and events leading to imprecision in results, it remains unclear whether cyclosporin, MMF or leflunomide have any role in the treatment of children with IgAV and severe kidney disease. We did not identify any studies which evaluated corticosteroids "}

Mean age ranged from 66 to 71.3 years and most participants were men. Four trials recruited people with CSA associated with heart failure, and one study included people with primary CSA. Types of pharmacological agents were acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ) , buspirone (anxiolytic), theophylline (methylxanthine derivative) and triazolam (hypnotic), which were given for between three days and one week. Only the study on buspirone reported a formal evaluation of adverse events. These events were rare and mild. No studies reported serious adverse events, quality of sleep, quality of life, all\u2010cause mortality, or time to life\u2010saving cardiovascular intervention. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors versus inactive control Results were from two studies of acetazolamide versus placebo (n = 12) and acetazolamide versus no acetazolamide (n = 18) for CSA associated with heart failure. One study reported short\u2010term outcomes and the other reported intermediate\u2010term outcomes. We are uncertain whether carbonic anhydrase inhibitors compared to inactive control reduce cAHI in the short term (mean difference (MD) \u221226.00 events per hour, 95% CI \u221243.84 to \u22128.16; 1 study, 12 participants; very low certainty). Similarly, we are uncertain whether carbonic anhydrase inhibitors compared to inactive control reduce AHI in the short term (MD \u221223.00 events per hour, 95% CI \u221237.70 to 8.30; 1 study, 12 participants; very low certainty) or in the intermediate term (MD \u22126.98 events per hour, 95% CI \u221210.66 to \u22123.30; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty). The effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors on cardiovascular mortality in the intermediate term was also uncertain (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.48; 1 study, 18 participants; very low certainty). Anxiolytics versus inactive control Results were based on one study of buspirone versus placebo for CSA associated with heart failure (n = 16). The median difference between groups for cAHI was \u22125.00 events per hour (IQR \u22128.00 to \u22120.50), the median difference for AHI was \u22126.00 events per hour (IQR \u22128.80 to \u22121.80), and the median difference on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for daytime sleepiness was 0 points (IQR \u22121.0 to 0.00). Methylxanthine derivatives versus inactive control Results were based on one study of theophylline versus placebo for CSA associated with heart failure (n = 15). We are uncertain whether methylxanthine derivatives compared to inactive control reduce cAHI (MD \u221220.00 events per hour, 95% CI \u221232.15 to \u22127.85; 15 participants; very low certainty) or AHI (MD \u221219.00 events per hour, 95% CI \u221230.27 to \u22127.73; 15 participants; very low certainty). Hypnotics versus inactive control Results were based on one trial of triazolam versus placebo for primary CSA (n = 5). Due to very serious methodological limitations and insufficient reporting of outcome measures, we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effects of this intervention. ", "conclusion": " There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological therapy in the treatment of CSA. Although small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents for CSA associated with heart failure in reducing the number of respiratory events during sleep, we were unable to assess whether this reduction may impact the quality of life of people with CSA, owing to scarce reporting of important clinical outcomes such as sleep quality or subjective impression of daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, the trials mostly had short\u2010term follow\u2010up. There is a need for high\u2010quality trials that evaluate longer\u2010term effects of pharmacological interventions. "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD010003.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of splinting for people with CTS. \n\nMain results:\n We included 29 trials randomising 1937 adults with CTS. The trials ranged from 21 to 234 participants, with mean ages between 42 and 60 years. The mean duration of CTS symptoms was seven weeks to five years. Eight studies with 523 hands compared splinting with no active intervention (no treatment, sham\u2010kinesiology tape or sham\u2010laser); 20 studies compared splinting (or splinting delivered along with another non\u2010surgical intervention) with another non\u2010surgical intervention; and three studies compared different splinting regimens (e.g. night\u2010time only versus full time). Trials were generally at high risk of bias for one or more domains, including lack of blinding (all included studies) and lack of information about randomisation or allocation concealment in 23 studies. For the primary comparison, splinting compared to no active treatment, splinting may provide little or no benefits in symptoms in the short term (< 3 months). The mean Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) (scale 1 to 5, higher is worse; minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 1 point) was 0.37 points better with splint (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 better to 0.08 worse; 6 studies, 306 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) compared with no active treatment. Removing studies with high or unclear risk of bias due to lack of randomisation or allocation concealment supported our conclusion of no important effect (mean difference (MD) 0.01 points worse with splint; 95% CI 0.20 better to 0.22 worse; 3 studies, 124 participants). In the long term (> 3 months), we are uncertain about the effect of splinting on symptoms (mean BCTQ SSS 0.64 better with splinting; 95% CI 1.2 better to 0.08 better; 2 studies, 144 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Splinting probably does not improve hand function in the short term and may not improve hand function in the long term. In the short term, the mean BCTQ Functional Status Scale (FSS) (1 to 5, higher is worse; MCID 0.7 points) was 0.24 points better (95% CI 0.44 better to 0.03 better; 6 studies, 306 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) with splinting compared with no active treatment. In the long term, the mean BCTQ FSS was 0.25 points better (95% CI 0.68 better to 0.18 worse; 1 study, 34 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) with splinting compared with no active treatment. Night\u2010time splinting may result in a higher rate of overall improvement in the short term (risk ratio (RR) 3.86, 95% CI 2.29 to 6.51; 1 study, 80 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 2, 95% CI 2 to 2; low\u2010certainty evidence).  We are uncertain if splinting decreases referral to surgery, RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.58; 3 studies, 243 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).  None of the trials reported health\u2010related quality of life. Low\u2010certainty evidence from one study suggests that splinting may have a higher rate of adverse events, which were transient, but the 95% CIs included no effect. Seven of 40 participants (18%) reported adverse effects in the splinting group and 0 of 40 participants (0%) in the no active treatment group (RR 15.0, 95% CI 0.89 to 254.13; 1 study, 80 participants).  There was low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence for the other comparisons: splinting may not provide additional benefits in symptoms or hand function when given together with corticosteroid injection (moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or with rehabilitation (low\u2010certainty evidence); nor when compared with corticosteroid (injection or oral; low certainty), exercises (low certainty), kinesiology taping (low certainty), rigid taping (low certainty), platelet\u2010rich plasma (moderate certainty), or extracorporeal shock wave treatment (moderate certainty). Splinting for 12 weeks may not be better than six weeks, but six months of splinting may be better than six weeks of splinting in improving symptoms and function (low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether splinting benefits people with CTS. Limited evidence does not exclude small improvements in CTS symptoms and hand function, but they may not be clinically important, and the clinical relevance of small differences with splinting is unclear. Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that people may have a greater chance of experiencing overall improvement with night\u2010time splints than no treatment. As splinting is a relatively inexpensive intervention with no plausible long\u2010term harms, small effects could justify its use, particularly when patients are not interested in having surgery or injections. It is unclear if a splint is optimally worn full time or at night\u2010time only and whether long\u2010term use is better than short\u2010term use, but low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that the benefits may manifest in the long term.

All studies used the corticosteroid dexamethasone, with doses ranging from approximately 2 mg to 12 mg.  Improvement in vertigo Intratympanic corticosteroids may make little or no difference to the number of people who report an improvement in their vertigo at 6 to \u2264 12 months follow\u2010up (intratympanic corticosteroids 96.8%, placebo 96.6%, risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.10; 2 studies; 60 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) or at more than 12 months follow\u2010up (intratympanic corticosteroids 100%, placebo 96.3%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23; 2 studies; 58 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, we note the large improvement in the placebo group for these trials, which causes challenges in interpreting these results.  Change in vertigo Assessed with a global score One study (44 participants) assessed the change in vertigo at 3 to < 6 months using a global score, which considered the frequency, duration and severity of vertigo. This is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Assessed by frequency of vertigo Three studies (304 participants) assessed the change in frequency of vertigo episodes at 3 to < 6 months. Intratympanic corticosteroids may slightly reduce the frequency of vertigo episodes. The proportion of days affected by vertigo was 0.05 lower (absolute difference \u20105%) in those receiving intratympanic corticosteroids (95% CI \u20100.07 to \u20100.02; 3 studies; 472 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). This is equivalent to a difference of approximately 1.5 days fewer per month affected by vertigo in the corticosteroid group (with the control group having vertigo on approximately 2.5 to 3.5 days per month at the end of follow\u2010up, and those receiving corticosteroids having vertigo on approximately 1 to 2 days per month). However, this result should be interpreted with caution \u2010 we are aware of unpublished data at this time point in which corticosteroids failed to show a benefit over placebo. One study also assessed the change in frequency of vertigo at 6 to \u2264 12 months and > 12 months follow\u2010up. However, this is a single, small study and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Therefore, we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. Serious adverse events Four studies reported this outcome. There may be little or no effect on the occurrence of serious adverse events with intratympanic corticosteroids, but the evidence is very uncertain (intratympanic corticosteroids 3.0%, placebo 4.4%; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.85; 4 studies; 500 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " The evidence for intratympanic corticosteroids in the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is uncertain.

Improvement in vertigo was reported by more participants who received gentamicin at both 6 to \u2264 12 months (16/16 participants who received gentamicin, compared to 0/16 participants with no intervention; risk ratio (RR) 33.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 507; 1 study; 32 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and at > 12 months follow\u2010up (12/12 participants receiving gentamicin, compared to 6/10 participants receiving placebo; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.69; 1 study; 22 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported.  ", "conclusion": " The evidence for the use of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease is very uncertain. This is primarily due to the fact that there are few published RCTs in this area, and all the studies we identified enrolled a very small number of participants. As the studies assessed different outcomes, using different methods, and reported at different time points, we were not able to pool the results to obtain more reliable estimates of the efficacy of this treatment. More people may report an improvement in vertigo following gentamicin treatment, and scores of vertigo symptoms may also improve. However, the limitations of the evidence mean that we cannot be sure of these effects. Although there is the potential for intratympanic gentamicin to cause harm (for example, hearing loss) we did not find any information about the risks of treatment in this review.

From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty\u2010five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case\u2010control studies. Twenty\u2010three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years.  We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies.  There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta\u2010analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low\u2010 (LDL) and high\u2010 (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC\u2010PDR.  ", "conclusion": " Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight\u2010threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.

Nine studies were suitable for inclusion in quantitative meta\u2010analysis (670 randomised participants). Five studies compared laparoscopic with open PD catheter insertion, and four studies compared a 'medical' insertion technique with open surgical PD catheter insertion: percutaneous (2) and peritoneoscopic (2). Random sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias in eight studies. Allocation concealment was reported poorly, with only five studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias. Performance bias was judged to be high risk in 10 studies. Attrition bias and reporting bias were judged to be low in 14 and 12 studies, respectively. Six studies compared laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with open surgical insertion. Five studies could be meta\u2010analysed (394 participants). For our primary outcomes, data were either not reported in a format that could be meta\u2010analysed (early PD catheter function, long\u2010term catheter function) or not reported at all (technique failure). One death was reported in the laparoscopic group and none in the open surgical group. In low certainty evidence, laparoscopic PD catheter insertion may make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (4 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; I\u00b2 = 7%), PD catheter removal (4 studies, 257 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I\u00b2 = 0%), and dialysate leakage (4 studies, 330 participants: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.49 to 4.02; I\u00b2 = 0%), but may reduce the risk of haemorrhage (2 studies, 167 participants: RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 10.31; I\u00b2 = 33%) and catheter tip migration (4 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.92; I\u00b2 = 12%). Four studies compared a medical insertion technique with open surgical insertion (276 participants). Technique failure was not reported, and no deaths were reported (2 studies, 64 participants). In low certainty evidence, medical insertion may make little or no difference to early PD catheter function (3 studies, 212 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83; I\u00b2 = 0%), while one study reported long\u2010term PD function may improve with peritoneoscopic insertion (116 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). Peritoneoscopic catheter insertion may reduce the episodes of early peritonitis (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; I\u00b2 = 0%) and dialysate leakage (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71; I\u00b2 = 0%). Medical insertion had uncertain effects on catheter tip migration (2 studies, 90 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.73; I\u00b2 = 0%). Most of the studies examined were small and of poor quality, increasing the risk of imprecision. There was also a significant risk of bias therefore cautious interpretation of results is advised. ", "conclusion": " The available studies show that the evidence needed to guide clinicians in developing their PD catheter insertion service is lacking. No PD catheter insertion technique had lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction. High\u2010quality, evidence\u2010based data are urgently required, utilising multi\u2010centre RCTs or large cohort studies, in order to provide definitive guidance relating to PD catheter insertion modality.

Sample sizes in the included studies ranged from 10 to 170. All but two studies included adult patients (\u2265 18 years). Two studies included children. Most studies had more male patients (range 46.6% to 80%). All studies were placebo\u2010controlled and four studies had three treatment arms. Three studies investigated topical tranexamic acid; the other studies reported the use of intravenous tranexamic acid. For our primary outcome, surgical field bleeding score measured with the Boezaart or Wormald grading score, we pooled data from 13 studies. The pooled result demonstrated that tranexamic acid probably reduces the surgical field bleeding score, with a standardised mean difference (SMD) of \u20100.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) \u20101.23 to \u20100.51; 13 studies, 772 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). A SMD below \u20100.70 represents a large effect (in either direction). Tranexamic acid may result in a slight reduction in blood loss during surgery compared to placebo with a mean difference (MD) of \u201070.32 mL (95% CI \u201092.28 to \u201048.35 mL; 12 studies, 802 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Tranexamic acid probably has little to no effect on the development of significant adverse events (seizures or thromboembolism) within 24 hours of surgery, with no events in either group and a risk difference (RD) of 0.00 (95% CI \u20100.02 to 0.02; 8 studies, 664 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, there were no studies reporting significant adverse event data with a longer duration of follow\u2010up. Tranexamic acid probably results in little difference in the duration of surgery with a MD of \u201013.04 minutes (95% CI \u201019.27 to \u20106.81; 10 studies, 666 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Tranexamic acid probably results in little to no difference in the incidence of incomplete surgery, with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI \u20100.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in surgical complications, again with no events in either group and a RD of 0.00 (95% CI \u20100.09 to 0.09; 2 studies, 58 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), although these numbers are too small to draw robust conclusions. Tranexamic acid may result in little to no difference in the likelihood of postoperative bleeding (placement of packing or revision surgery within three days of surgery) (RD \u20100.01, 95% CI \u20100.04 to 0.02; 6 studies, 404 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). There were no studies with longer follow\u2010up. ", "conclusion": " There is moderate\u2010certainty evidence to support the beneficial value of topical or intravenous tranexamic acid during endoscopic sinus surgery with respect to surgical field bleeding score. Low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence suggests a slight decrease in total blood loss during surgery and duration of surgery. Whilst there is moderate\u2010certainty evidence that tranexamic acid does not lead to more immediate significant adverse events compared to placebo, there is no evidence regarding the risk of serious adverse events more than 24 hours after surgery. There is low\u2010certainty evidence that tranexamic acid may not change postoperative bleeding. There is not enough evidence available to draw robust conclusions about incomplete surgery or surgical complications. "}

Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug\u2010containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high\u2010income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs. We were unable to perform the planned network meta\u2010analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review. Systemic drug treatments We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low\u2010certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants). Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding. Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence due to imprecision). There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non\u2010cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE). Topical drug treatments Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open\u2010label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants). The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open\u2010label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. The other three outcomes were associated with very low\u2010certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days. We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes. ", "conclusion": " Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased. Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future. "}

Probiotics  may achieve more treatment success when compared with placebo at the end of the treatment, with 50% success in the probiotic group versus 33% success in the placebo group (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.36; 554 participants; 6 studies; I 2  = 70%; low\u2010certainty evidence).  It is not clear whether probiotics are more effective than placebo for complete resolution of pain, with 42% success in the probiotic group versus 27% success in the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.56; 460 participants; 6 studies; I 2  = 70%; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We judged the evidence to be of very low certainty due to high inconsistency and risk of bias. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from our meta\u2010analyses of the pain severity and pain frequency outcomes due to very high unexplained heterogeneity leading to very low\u2010certainty evidence.

Meta\u2010analysis showed no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events between probiotics (1/275) and placebo (1/269) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.12). The results were identical for the total patients with any reported adverse event outcome. However, these results are of very low certainty due to imprecision from the very low numbers of events and risk of bias. Synbiotics  may result in more treatment success at study end when compared with placebo, with 47% success in the probiotic group versus 35% success in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.74; 310 participants; 4 studies; I 2  = 0%; low certainty).

The evidence demonstrates little to no difference between probiotics or synbiotics and placebo in complete resolution of pain. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of probiotics or synbiotics on the frequency and severity of pain as the evidence was all of very low certainty due to significant unexplained heterogeneity or imprecision. There were no reported cases of serious adverse events when using probiotics or synbiotics amongst the included studies, although a review of RCTs may not be the best context to assess long\u2010term safety. The available evidence on adverse effects was of very low certainty and no conclusions could be made in this review. Safety will always be a priority in paediatric populations when considering any treatment. Reporting of all adverse events, adverse events needing withdrawal, serious adverse events and, particularly, long\u2010term safety outcomes are vital to meaningfully move forward the evidence base in this field. Further targeted and appropriately designed RCTs are needed to address the gaps in the evidence base. In particular, appropriate powering of studies to confirm the safety of specific strains not yet investigated and studies to investigate long\u2010term follow\u2010up of patients are both warranted.

To generate a relative ranking of myopia control interventions according to their efficacy. To produce a brief economic commentary, summarising the economic evaluations assessing myopia control interventions in children. To maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach.  \n\nMain results:\n We included 64 studies that randomised 11,617 children, aged 4 to 18 years. Studies were mostly conducted in China or other Asian countries (39 studies, 60.9%) and North America (13 studies, 20.3%). Fifty\u2010seven studies (89%) compared myopia control interventions (multifocal spectacles, peripheral plus spectacles (PPSL), undercorrected single vision spectacles (SVLs), multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCL), orthokeratology, rigid gas\u2010permeable contact lenses (RGP); or pharmacological interventions (including high\u2010 (HDA), moderate\u2010 (MDA) and low\u2010dose (LDA) atropine, pirenzipine or 7\u2010methylxanthine) against an inactive control. Study duration was 12 to 36 months. The overall certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Since the networks in the NMA were poorly connected, most estimates versus control were as, or more, imprecise than the corresponding direct estimates. Consequently, we mostly report estimates based on direct (pairwise) comparisons below. At one year, in 38 studies (6525 participants analysed), the median change in SER for controls was \u22120.65 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (mean difference (MD) 0.90 D, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 1.18), MDA (MD 0.65 D, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.03), LDA (MD 0.38 D, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66), pirenzipine (MD 0.32 D, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49), MFSCL (MD 0.26 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.35), PPSLs (MD 0.51 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82), and multifocal spectacles (MD 0.14 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.21). By contrast, there was little or no evidence that RGP (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.10), 7\u2010methylxanthine (MD 0.07 D, 95% CI \u22120.09 to 0.24) or undercorrected SVLs (MD \u22120.15 D, 95% CI \u22120.29 to 0.00) reduce progression.  At two years, in 26 studies (4949 participants), the median change in SER for controls was \u22121.02 D. The following interventions may reduce SER progression compared to controls: HDA (MD 1.26 D, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.36), MDA (MD 0.45 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83), LDA (MD 0.24 D, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), pirenzipine (MD 0.41 D, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69), MFSCL (MD 0.30 D, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.41), and multifocal spectacles  (MD 0.19 D, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30). PPSLs (MD 0.34 D, 95% CI \u22120.08 to 0.76) may also reduce progression, but the results were inconsistent. For RGP, one study found a benefit and another found no difference with control. We found no difference in SER change for undercorrected SVLs (MD 0.02 D, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.09).

At two years, in 21 studies (4169 participants), the median change in axial length for controls was 0.56 mm. The following interventions may reduce axial elongation compared to controls: HDA (MD \u22120.47mm, 95% CI \u22120.61 to \u22120.34), MDA (MD \u22120.33 mm, 95% CI \u22120.46 to \u22120.20), orthokeratology (MD \u22120.28 mm, (95% CI \u22120.38 to \u22120.19), LDA (MD \u22120.16 mm, 95% CI \u22120.20 to  \u22120.12), MFSCL (MD \u22120.15 mm, 95% CI \u22120.19 to \u22120.12), and multifocal spectacles (MD \u22120.07 mm, 95% CI \u22120.12 to \u22120.03). PPSL may reduce progression (MD \u22120.20 mm, 95% CI \u22120.45 to 0.05) but results were inconsistent. We found little or no evidence that undercorrected SVLs (MD \u20100.01 mm, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.03) or RGP (MD 0.03 mm, 95% CI \u22120.05 to 0.12) reduce axial length. There was inconclusive evidence on whether treatment cessation increases myopia progression. Adverse events and treatment adherence were not consistently reported, and only one study reported quality of life. No studies reported environmental interventions reporting progression in children with myopia, and no economic evaluations assessed interventions for myopia control in children. ", "conclusion": " Studies mostly compared pharmacological and optical treatments to slow the progression of myopia with an inactive comparator. Effects at one year provided evidence that these interventions may slow refractive change and reduce axial elongation, although results were often heterogeneous. A smaller body of evidence is available at two or three years, and uncertainty remains about the sustained effect of these interventions. Longer\u2010term and better\u2010quality studies comparing myopia control interventions used alone or in combination are needed, and improved methods for monitoring and reporting adverse effects.  "}

The studies had relatively small sample sizes and the overall risk of bias was low. For the primary maternal outcomes, meta\u2010analysis showed that myo\u2010inositol may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.90; 6 studies, 1140 women) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.61; 5 studies, 1052 women). However, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. For the primary neonatal outcomes, only one study measured the risk of a large\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age infant and found myo\u2010inositol was associated with both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.02; 1 study, 234 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other primary neonatal outcomes (perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite). For the secondary maternal outcomes, we are unclear about the effect of myo\u2010inositol on weight gain during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) \u20100.25 kilogram (kg), 95% CI \u20101.26 to 0.75 kg; 4 studies, 831 women) and perineal trauma (RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 to 35.25; 1 study, 234 women) because the evidence was assessed as being very low\u2010certainty. Further, myo\u2010inositol may result in little to no difference in caesarean section (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.07; 4 studies, 829 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on the other secondary maternal outcomes (postnatal depression and the development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus). For the secondary neonatal outcomes, meta\u2010analysis showed no neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 10.52; 4 studies; 671 infants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). However, myo\u2010inositol may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.70; 4 studies; 829 infants). There were insufficient data for a number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data were reported for any of the long\u2010term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service utilisation outcomes. ", "conclusion": " Evidence from seven studies shows that antenatal dietary supplementation with myo\u2010inositol during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and preterm birth. Limited data suggest that supplementation with myo\u2010inositol may not reduce the risk of a large\u2010for\u2010gestational\u2010age infant.  The current evidence is based on small studies that were not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. Six of the included studies were conducted in Italy and one in Ireland, which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency among doses of myo\u2010inositol, the timing of administration and study population. As a result, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for many outcomes to low or very low certainty. Further studies for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors. Myo\u2010inositol at different doses, frequency and timing of administration, should be compared with placebo, diet and exercise, and pharmacological interventions. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up should be considered and outcomes should include potential harms, including adverse effects.   "}

Forty\u2010five studies were conducted in high\u2010income countries, and eight in low\u2010and middle\u2010income countries. Twenty studies addressed in\u2010person home\u2010based rehabilitation, 28 studies addressed home\u2010based telerehabilitation services, and five studies addressed both modes of delivery. The studies mainly explored the perspectives of healthcare providers, patients with a range of different health conditions, and their informal caregivers and family members.  Based on our GRADE\u2010CERQual assessments, we had high confidence in eight of the findings, and moderate confidence in five, indicating that it is highly likely or likely respectively that these findings are a reasonable representation of the phenomenon of interest. There were two findings with low confidence. High and moderate confidence findings Home\u2010based rehabilitation services delivered in\u2010person or through telerehabilitation  Patients experience home\u2010based services as convenient and less disruptive of their everyday activities. Patients and providers also suggest that these services can encourage patients' self\u2010management and can make them feel empowered about the rehabilitation process. But patients, family members, and providers describe privacy and confidentiality issues when services are provided at home. These include the increased privacy of being able to exercise at home but also the loss of privacy when one\u2019s home life is visible to others.  Patients and providers also describe other factors that can affect the success of home\u2010based rehabilitation services. These include support from providers and family members, good communication with providers, the requirements made of patients and their surroundings, and the transition from hospital to home\u2010based services. Telerehabilitation specifically Patients, family members and providers see telerehabilitation as an opportunity to make services more available. But providers point to practical problems when assessing whether patients are performing their exercises correctly. Providers and patients also describe interruptions from family members.  In addition, providers complain of a lack of equipment, infrastructure and maintenance and patients refer to usability issues and frustration with digital technology. Providers have different opinions about whether telerehabilitation is cost\u2010efficient for them. But many patients see telerehabilitation as affordable and cost\u2010saving if the equipment and infrastructure have been provided. Patients and providers suggest that telerehabilitation can change the nature of their relationship. For instance, some patients describe how telerehabilitation leads to easier and more relaxed communication. Other patients describe feeling abandoned when receiving telerehabilitation services.  Patients, family members and providers call for easy\u2010to\u2010use technologies and more training and support. They also suggest that at least some in\u2010person sessions with the provider are necessary. They feel that telerehabilitation services alone can make it difficult to make meaningful connections. They also explain that some services need the provider\u2019s hands. Providers highlight the importance of personalising the services to each person\u2019s needs and circumstances.

Grey literature and reference list searches did not identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and twelve full\u2010text studies were assessed for eligibility, of which four studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease\u2010specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention. Three studies measured academic achievement but only two studies provided effect estimates. Based on the vote\u2010counting method, we found contradictory results from the studies: one study showed a positive direction of effect and the other study showed a negative direction of effect. One study measured transition back to school and found a positive impact of education support favouring the intervention (SMD 0.18, 95% CI \u20100.46 to 0.96, no P value reported). The result came from a single study with a small sample size ( n  = 30), and produced a confidence interval that indicated the possibility of a very small or no effect. The overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be 'very low'. Two of four studies measured mental health (measured as self\u2010esteem). Both studies reported a positive impact of education support interventions on mental health; this was the only outcome for which the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be 'low' rather than 'very low'. No studies measured or reported quality of life or adverse effects. Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other bias) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (version 1). Overall risk of bias for all studies was assessed as 'high risk' because all studies had at least one domain at high risk of bias.

At best, we can say that we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either academic achievement or school engagement. Of the secondary outcomes, we are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school, or school re\u2010entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self\u2010esteem. Given the current state of the evidence of the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, we highlight some important implications for future research in this field to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.

None of the included studies had a high risk of bias, but two\u2010thirds of the included studies raised some concerns. This was mainly due to the lack of a predefined analysis plan or missing information about the randomisation process. Most included studies investigated both colon and rectal resections due to malignant and benign surgical indications. For MBP as well as oAB, the included studies used different regimens in terms of agent(s), dosage and timing. \u2028Data for all predefined outcomes could be extracted from the included studies. However, only four studies reported on side effects of bowel preparation, and none recorded the occurrence of adverse effects such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or the need to discontinue the intervention due to side effects. Seventeen trials compared MBP+oAB with sole MBP.\u2028The incidence of SSI could be reduced through MBP+oAB by 44% (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.74; 3917 participants from 16 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and the risk of anastomotic leakage could be reduced by 40% (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.99; 2356 participants from 10 studies; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

", "conclusion": " Based on moderate\u2010certainty evidence, our results suggest that MBP+oAB is probably more effective than MBP alone in preventing postoperative complications. In particular, with respect to our primary outcomes, SSI and anastomotic leakage, a lower incidence was demonstrated using MBP+oAB. Whether oAB alone is actually equivalent to MBP+oAB, or leads to a reduction or increase in the risk of postoperative complications, cannot be clarified in light of the low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence. Similarly, it remains unclear whether omitting preoperative bowel preparation leads to an increase in the risk of postoperative complications due to limited evidence. Additional RCTs, particularly on the comparisons of MBP+oAB versus oAB alone or nBP, are needed to assess the impact of oAB alone or nBP compared with MBP+oAB on postoperative complications and to improve confidence in the estimated effect. In addition, RCTs focusing on subgroups (e.g. in relation to type and location of colon resections) or reporting side effects of the intervention are needed to determine the most effective approach of preoperative bowel preparation.

Reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence were risk of bias (particularly selection and performance bias); imprecision (results from single, often small studies, wide CIs, and CIs crossing the null effect); and inconsistency (statistical heterogeneity). ", "conclusion": " There is moderate\u2010certainty evidence that cognitive\u2010behavioural approaches such as anger management and PBS may reduce outwardly directed aggressive behaviour in the short term but there is less certainty about the evidence in the medium and long term, particularly in relation to other outcomes such as quality of life. There is some evidence to suggest that combining more than one intervention may have cumulative benefits. Most studies were small and there is a need for larger, robust randomised controlled trials, particularly for interventions where the certainty of evidence is very low. More trials are needed that focus on children and whether psychological interventions lead to reductions in the use of psychotropic medications. "}

Participant ages ranged from 1 to 84 years, with two trials providing data specific to participants under five years (n = 69) and eight trials providing data specific to participants aged 5 to 16 (n = 766). Across the trials, 1245 participants were male and 1229 were female, with two studies not reporting sex distribution. Fifteen trials contributed to the primary outcome analysis of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. The duration of trials ranged from three to 40 months; all but two investigated effects of administering cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). As in the previous Cochrane Review, the majority of participants had mild to moderate asthma, and profound vitamin D deficiency (25\u2010hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 25 nmol/L) at baseline was rare. Administration of vitamin D or its hydroxylated metabolites did not reduce or increase the proportion of participants experiencing one or more asthma exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.34; I 2  = 0%; 14 studies, 1778 participants; high\u2010quality evidence). This equates to an absolute risk of 226 per 1000 (95% CI 185 to 273) in the pooled vitamin D group, compared to a baseline risk of 219 participants per 1000 in the pooled placebo group. We also found no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the rate of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19; I 2  = 60%; 10 studies, 1599 participants; high\u2010quality evidence), or the time to first exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.15; I 2  = 22%; 3 studies, 850 participants; high\u2010quality evidence). Subgroup analysis did not reveal any evidence of effect modification by baseline vitamin D status, vitamin D dose, frequency of dosing regimen, or age. A single trial investigating administration of calcidiol reported a benefit of the intervention for the primary outcome of asthma control. Vitamin D supplementation did not influence any secondary efficacy outcome meta\u2010analysed, which were all based on moderate\u2010 or high\u2010quality evidence. We observed no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.41; I 2  = 0%; 12 studies, 1556 participants; high\u2010quality evidence). The effect of vitamin D on fatal asthma exacerbations was not estimable, as no such events occurred in any trial. Six studies reported adverse reactions potentially attributable to vitamin D. These occurred across treatment and control arms and included hypercalciuria, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, gastrointestinal symptoms and mild itch. In one trial, we could not ascertain the total number of participants with hypercalciuria from the trial report. We assessed three trials as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain; none of these contributed data to the analysis of the outcomes reported above. Sensitivity analyses that excluded these trials from each outcome to which they contributed did not change the null findings. ", "conclusion": " In contrast to findings of our previous Cochrane Review on this topic, this updated review does not find evidence to support a role for vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites to reduce risk of asthma exacerbations or improve asthma control. Participants with severe asthma and those with baseline 25(OH)D concentrations < 25 nmol/L were poorly represented, so further research is warranted here. A single study investigating effects of calcidiol yielded positive results, so further studies investigating effects of this metabolite are needed. "}

We identified two ongoing RTCs. All trials had high risk of performance bias, as it was impossible to blind participants and personnel to the intervention. Three trials were terminated early. One trial was at high risk of attrition bias because of substantial loss to follow\u2010up after one year and a high proportion of participants transferring from ET to CMT.

This effect was still apparent at long\u2010term follow\u2010up but appeared to be due to the early risks of ET; therefore, there may be no clear difference between the interventions in terms of their effects on long\u2010term stroke and death. The impact of delayed ET intervention (more than three weeks after a qualifying event) warrants further study. "}

There was one study each for two different comparisons.  Nebuliser target inhalation mode versus standard inhalation mode The included parallel study was carried out over 10 weeks after a run\u2010in period of four to six weeks. The study compared the effects of a digitally enhanced inhalation mode (target inhalation mode) for nebulised antibiotics compared to standard mode in children attending a regional CF clinic in the United Kingdom. The study's primary outcome was the time taken to complete the inhaled treatment, but investigators also reported on adherence to therapy. The results showed that there may be an improvement in adherence with the target inhalation mode when this intervention is used (mean difference (MD) 24.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 45.05; low\u2010certainty evidence). The target inhalation mode may make little or no difference to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted (MD 1.00 % predicted, 95% CI \u20109.37 to 11.37; low\u2010certainty evidence).

The intervention group also receiving access to an online web\u2010based platform, CFHealthHub, which offered tailored, flexible support from the study interventionist as well as access to their adherence data, educational and problem\u2010solving information throughout the 12\u2010month trial period. We graded all evidence as moderate certainty. Compared to usual care, the digital intervention probably improves adherence to inhaled therapy (MD 18%, 95% CI 12.90 to 23.10); probably leads to slightly reduced treatment burden (MD 5.1, 95% CI 1.79 to 8.41); and may lead to slightly improved FEV 1  % predicted (MD 3.70, 95% CI \u20100.23 to 7.63). There is probably little or no difference in the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations or QoL between the two groups.

In a shorter time frame, technological enhancement of inhaling antibiotics may improve adherence to treatment (low\u2010certainty evidence). There may be little or no effect on lung function with either intervention, and online monitoring probably makes no difference to pulmonary exacerbations.  Future research should assess the effect of digital technology on adherence in both children and adults. Consideration of adherence to the total treatment regimen is also important, as an improvement in adherence to inhaled therapies could come at the cost of adherence to other parts of the treatment regimen.

Eight randomised controlled studies (259 participants) were included in the analysis; five were of cross\u2010over design. The 14 remaining studies were cross\u2010over studies with inadequate reports for complete assessment. The study size ranged from seven to 65 participants. The age of the participants ranged from six to 63 years (mean age 18.7 years). In 13 studies follow up lasted a single day. However, there were two long\u2010term randomised controlled studies with follow up of one to three years. Most of the studies did not report on key quality items, and therefore, have an unclear risk of bias in terms of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and outcome assessor blinding. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies blinded participants or the personnel applying the interventions. However, most of the studies reported on all planned outcomes, had adequate follow up, assessed compliance, and used an intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis.

Most evaluated CS groups; eight examined individual CS. Participants' median age was 79.7 years. Sixteen studies included participants resident in care homes or hospitals. Study quality showed indications of improvement since the previous review, with few areas of high risk of bias. Assessors were clearly blinded to treatment allocation in most studies (81%) and most studies (81%) reported use of a treatment manual by those delivering the intervention. However, in a substantial number of studies (59%), we could not find details on all aspects of the randomisation procedures, leading us to rate the risk of selection bias as unclear. We entered data in the meta\u2010analyses from 36 studies (2704 participants; CS: 1432, controls: 1272). The primary analysis was on changes evident immediately following the treatment period (median length 10 weeks; range 4 to 52 weeks). Only eight studies provided data allowing evaluation of whether effects were subsequently maintained (four at 6\u2010 to 12\u2010week follow\u2010up; four at 8\u2010 to 12\u2010month follow\u2010up). No negative effects were reported. Overall, we found moderate\u2010quality evidence for a small benefit in cognition associated with CS (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). In the 25 studies, with 1893 participants, reporting the widely used MMSE (Mini\u2010Mental State Examination) test for cognitive function in dementia, there was moderate\u2010quality evidence of a clinically important difference of 1.99 points between CS and controls (95% CI: 1.24, 2.74). In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, again examining the difference between CS and controls on changes immediately following the intervention period, we found moderate\u2010quality evidence of a slight improvement in self\u2010reported QoL (18 studies, 1584 participants; SMD: 0.25 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.42]) as well as in QoL ratings made by proxies (staff or caregivers). We found high\u2010quality evidence for clinically relevant improvements in staff/interviewer ratings of communication and social interaction (5 studies, 702 participants; SMD: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.70]) and for slight benefits in instrumental Activities of Daily Living, self\u2010reported depressed mood, staff/interviewer\u2010rated anxiety and general behaviour rating scales. We found moderate\u2010quality evidence for slight improvements in behaviour that challenges and in basic Activities of Daily Living and low\u2010quality evidence for a slight improvement in staff/interviewer\u2010rated depressed mood. A few studies reported a range of outcomes for family caregivers. We found moderate\u2010quality evidence that overall CS made little or no difference to caregivers' mood or anxiety. We found a high level of inconsistency between studies in relation to both cognitive outcomes and QoL. In exploratory subgroup analyses, we did not identify an effect of modality (group versus individual) or, for group studies, of setting (community versus care home), total number of group sessions or type of control condition (treatment\u2010as\u2010usual versus active controls). However, we did find improvements in cognition were larger where group sessions were more frequent (twice weekly or more versus once weekly) and where average severity of dementia among participants at the start of the intervention was 'mild' rather than 'moderate'. Imbalance in numbers of studies and participants between subgroups and residual inconsistency requires these exploratory findings to be interpreted cautiously. ", "conclusion": " In this updated review, now with a much more extensive evidence base, we have again identified small, short\u2010term cognitive benefits for people with mild to moderate dementia participating in CS programmes. From a smaller number of studies, we have also found clinically relevant improvements in communication and social interaction and slight benefits in a range of outcomes including QoL, mood and behaviour that challenges. There are relatively few studies of individual CS, and further research is needed to delineate the effectiveness of different delivery methods (including digital and remote, individual and group) and of multi\u2010component programmes. We have identified that the frequency of group sessions and level of dementia severity may influence the outcomes of CS, and these aspects should be studied further. There remains an evidence gap in relation to the potential benefits of longer\u2010term CS programmes and their clinical significance. "}

Six of the new trials were conducted during the COVID\u201019 pandemic; two from Mexico, and one each from Denmark, Bangladesh, England, and Norway. We identified four ongoing studies, of which one is completed, but unreported, evaluating masks concurrent with the COVID\u201019 pandemic. Many studies were conducted during non\u2010epidemic influenza periods. Several were conducted during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and others in epidemic influenza seasons up to 2016. Therefore, many studies were conducted in the context of lower respiratory viral circulation and transmission compared to COVID\u201019. The included studies were conducted in heterogeneous settings, ranging from suburban schools to hospital wards in high\u2010income countries; crowded inner city settings in low\u2010income countries; and an immigrant neighbourhood in a high\u2010income country. Adherence with interventions was low in many studies. The risk of bias for the RCTs and cluster\u2010RCTs was mostly high or unclear. Medical/surgical masks compared to no masks We included 12 trials (10 cluster\u2010RCTs) comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the spread of viral respiratory illness (two trials with healthcare workers and 10 in the community). Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza\u2010like illness (ILI)/COVID\u201019 like illness compared to not wearing masks (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.09; 9 trials, 276,917 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence. Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza/SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 compared to not wearing masks (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 6 trials, 13,919 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Harms were rarely measured and poorly reported (very low\u2010certainty evidence). N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks We pooled trials comparing N95/P2 respirators with medical/surgical masks (four in healthcare settings and one in a household setting). We are very uncertain on the effects of N95/P2 respirators compared with medical/surgical masks on the outcome of clinical respiratory illness (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 3 trials, 7779 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). N95/P2 respirators compared with medical/surgical masks may be effective for ILI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.03; 5 trials, 8407 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence is limited by imprecision and heterogeneity for these subjective outcomes. The use of a N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little or no difference for the objective and more precise outcome of laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza infection (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; 5 trials, 8407 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Restricting pooling to healthcare workers made no difference to the overall findings. Harms were poorly measured and reported, but discomfort wearing medical/surgical masks or N95/P2 respirators was mentioned in several studies (very low\u2010certainty evidence).  One previously reported ongoing RCT has now been published and observed that medical/surgical masks were non\u2010inferior to N95 respirators in a large study of 1009 healthcare workers in four countries providing direct care to COVID\u201019 patients.  Hand hygiene compared to control Nineteen trials compared hand hygiene interventions with controls with sufficient data to include in meta\u2010analyses. Settings included schools, childcare centres and homes. Comparing hand hygiene interventions with controls (i.e. no intervention), there was a 14% relative reduction in the number of people with ARIs in the hand hygiene group (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90; 9 trials, 52,105 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), suggesting a probable benefit. In absolute terms this benefit would result in a reduction from 380 events per 1000 people to 327 per 1000 people (95% CI 308 to 342). When considering the more strictly defined outcomes of ILI and laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza, the estimates of effect for ILI (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.09; 11 trials, 34,503 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), and laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.30; 8 trials, 8332 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), suggest the intervention made little or no difference. We pooled 19 trials (71, 210 participants) for the composite outcome of ARI or ILI or influenza, with each study only contributing once and the most comprehensive outcome reported. Pooled data showed that hand hygiene may be beneficial with an 11% relative reduction of respiratory illness (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; low\u2010certainty evidence), but with high heterogeneity. In absolute terms this benefit would result in a reduction from 200 events per 1000 people to 178 per 1000 people (95% CI 166 to 188). Few trials measured and reported harms (very low\u2010certainty evidence). We found no RCTs on gowns and gloves, face shields, or screening at entry ports. ", "conclusion": " The high risk of bias in the trials, variation in outcome measurement, and relatively low adherence with the interventions during the studies hampers drawing firm conclusions. There were additional RCTs during the pandemic related to physical interventions but a relative paucity given the importance of the question of masking and its relative effectiveness and the concomitant measures of mask adherence which would be highly relevant to the measurement of effectiveness, especially in the elderly and in young children. There is uncertainty about the effects of face masks. The low to moderate certainty of evidence means our confidence in the effect estimate is limited, and that the true effect may be different from the observed estimate of the effect. The pooled results of RCTs did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks. There were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection. Hand hygiene is likely to modestly reduce the burden of respiratory illness, and although this effect was also present when ILI and laboratory\u2010confirmed influenza were analysed separately, it was not found to be a significant difference for the latter two outcomes. Harms associated with physical interventions were under\u2010investigated. There is a need for large, well\u2010designed RCTs addressing the effectiveness of many of these interventions in multiple settings and populations, as well as the impact of adherence on effectiveness, especially in those most at risk of ARIs.

Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) \u22120.04 g/cm 2 , 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.11 to 0.03; I 2  = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm 2 , 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.06; I 2  = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (\u22120.03, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.01 to 0.03; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I 2  = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.

All included studies assessed visual acuity using a logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR chart). Of them, six (86%) studies assessed uncorrected distance visual acuity (the primary outcome of this review). Some studies also examined our secondary outcomes including uncorrected near, intermediate, and best\u2010corrected distance visual acuity, as well as contrast sensitivity. Study characteristics All participants had bilateral cataracts with no pre\u2010existing ocular pathologies or ocular surgery. Participants' mean age ranged from 55 to 74 years. Three studies reported on gender of participants, and they were mostly women. We assessed all of the included studies as being at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Two studies received financial support from manufacturers of lenses evaluated in this review, and at least one author of another study reported receiving payments for delivering lectures with lens manufacturers. Findings All studies compared trifocal versus bifocal IOL implantation on visual acuity outcomes measured on a LogMAR scale. At one year, trifocal IOL showed no evidence of effect on uncorrected distance visual acuity (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.04 to 0.04; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and uncorrected near visual acuity (MD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.06; I 2  = 0%; 2 studies, 107 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

For adults within 180 days of non\u2010cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack and a clinical history of prior ICH, there was no evidence of an effect of long\u2010term cilostazol compared to aspirin on MACE (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.40, P = 0.34; subgroup of 1 RCT; low\u2010certainty evidence), death (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.91, P = 0.37; subgroup of 1 RCT; low\u2010certainty evidence), or ICH (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.69, P = 0.70; subgroup of 1 RCT; low\u2010certainty evidence) over a median follow\u2010up of 1.8 years; all major occlusive vascular events and functional status were not reported. ", "conclusion": " We did not identify beneficial or hazardous effects of short\u2010term prophylactic dose parenteral anticoagulation and long\u2010term oral antiplatelet therapy after ICH on important outcomes. Although there was a significant reduction in MACE and all major occlusive vascular events after long\u2010term treatment with therapeutic dose oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation after ICH, the pooled estimates were imprecise, the certainty of evidence was only moderate, and effects on other important outcomes were uncertain. Large RCTs with a low risk of bias are required to resolve the ongoing dilemmas about antithrombotic treatment after ICH. "}

Of these, 50 studies had sufficient information to be included in quantitative meta\u2010analysis, including 17 cluster\u2010RCTs and 33 studies with non\u2010randomized study designs (20 NRCTs, one CBA, and 12 matched cohort studies). Most were conducted in LMICs and 86% were conducted in whole or part in rural areas. Studies covered three broad types of interventions: (1) providing access to any sanitation facility to participants without existing access practising open defecation, (2) improving participants' existing sanitation facility, or (3) behaviour change messaging to improve sanitation access or practices without providing hardware or subsidy, although many studies overlapped multiple categories. There was substantial heterogeneity amongst individual study results for all types of interventions. Providing access to any sanitation facility Providing access to sanitation facilities was evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs, and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all age groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.08; 7 trials, 40,129 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). In children under five years, access may have little or no effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 4 trials, 16,215 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis in non\u2010randomized studies was generally consistent with these findings. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.94; 15 studies, 73,511 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02; 11 studies, 25,614 participants).  Sanitation facility improvement Interventions designed to improve existing sanitation facilities were evaluated in three cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five and may reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.06; 3 trials, 14,900 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). However, some of these interventions, such as sewerage connection, are not easily randomized. Non\u2010randomized studies across participants of all ages provided estimates that improving sanitation facilities may reduce diarrhoea, but may be subject to confounding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.74; 23 studies, 117,639 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.78; 26 studies, 132,539 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, 12 studies, 23,353 participants).  Behaviour change messaging only (no hardware or subsidy provided) Strategies to promote behaviour change to construct, upgrade, or use sanitation facilities were evaluated in seven cluster\u2010RCTs in children under five, and probably reduce diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; 7 studies, 28,909 participants, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Additional analysis from two non\u2010randomized studies found no effect, though with very high uncertainty. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 9 studies, 31,080 participants). No studies measured the effects of this type of intervention in older populations.  Any sanitation intervention A pooled analysis of cluster\u2010RCTs across all sanitation interventions demonstrated that the interventions may reduce diarrhoea prevalence in all ages (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.95, 17 trials, 83,938 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence) and children under five (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; 14 trials, 60,024 participants, low\u2010certainty evidence). Non\u2010randomized comparisons also demonstrated a protective effect, but may be subject to confounding. Pooled estimates across randomized and non\u2010randomized studies provided similar protective estimates (all ages: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.82; 50 studies, 237,130 participants; children < 5 years: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; 32 studies, 80,047 participants). In subgroup analysis, there was some evidence of larger effects in studies with increased coverage amongst all participants (75% or higher coverage levels) and also some evidence that the effect decreased over longer follow\u2010up times for children under five years. There was limited evidence on other outcomes. However, there was some evidence that any sanitation intervention was protective against dysentery (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.00; 5 studies, 34,025 participants) and persistent diarrhoea (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75; 2 studies, 2665 participants), but not against clinic visits for diarrhoea (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.67; 2 studies, 3720 participants) or all\u2010cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89 to1.09; 7 studies, 46,123 participants). ", "conclusion": " There is evidence that sanitation interventions are effective at preventing diarrhoea, both for young children and all age populations. The actual level of effectiveness, however, varies by type of intervention and setting. There is a need for research to better understand the factors that influence effectiveness. "}

Most participants required low\u2010flow oxygen at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high\u2010 and upper\u2010middle\u2010income countries. We identified two studies that are awaiting classification and five ongoing studies. Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals with moderate to severe COVID\u201019 With moderate\u2010certainty evidence, remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all\u2010cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93 ,  95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 6 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants), day 60 (RR 0.85 ,  95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 73 fewer to 12 more; 1 study, 1281 participants), or in\u2010hospital mortality at up to day 150 (RR 0.93 ,  95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 5 more; 1 study, 8275 participants). Remdesivir probably increases the chance of clinical improvement at up to day 28 slightly (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; RD 68 more per 1000, 95% CI 37 more to 105 more; 4 studies, 2514 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). It probably decreases the risk of clinical worsening within 28 days (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; RD 135 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 198 fewer to 69 fewer; 2 studies, 1734 participants, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Remdesivir may make little or no difference to the rate of adverse events of any grade (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.18; RD 23 more per 1000, 95% CI 46 fewer to 104 more; 4 studies, 2498 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07; RD 44 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 96 fewer to 19 more; 4 studies, 2498 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). We considered risk of bias to be low, with some concerns for mortality and clinical course. We had some concerns for safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. Effects of remdesivir in non\u2010hospitalised individuals with mild COVID\u201019 One of the nine RCTs was conducted in the outpatient setting and included symptomatic people with a risk of progression. No deaths occurred within the 28 days observation period. We are uncertain about clinical improvement due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. Remdesivir probably decreases the risk of clinical worsening (hospitalisation) at up to day 28 (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.75; RD 46 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 57 fewer to 16 fewer; 562 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). We did not find any data for quality of life. Remdesivir may decrease the rate of serious adverse events at up to 28 days (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.70; RD 49 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 60 fewer to 20 fewer; 562 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), but it probably makes little or no difference to the risk of adverse events of any grade (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 111 fewer to 46 more; 562 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). We considered risk of bias to be low for mortality, clinical improvement, and safety outcomes. We identified a high risk of bias for clinical worsening. ", "conclusion": " Based on the available evidence up to 31 May 2022, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all\u2010cause mortality or in\u2010hospital mortality of individuals with moderate to severe COVID\u201019. The hospitalisation rate was reduced with remdesivir in one study including participants with mild to moderate COVID\u201019. It may be beneficial in the clinical course for both hospitalised and non\u2010hospitalised patients, but certainty remains limited. The applicability of the evidence to current practice may be limited by the recruitment of participants from mostly unvaccinated populations exposed to early variants of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus at the time the studies were undertaken.  Future studies should provide additional data on the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID\u201019 research, especially for different population subgroups.  "}

Studies compared IVIG with ASA, another dose or regimen of IVIG, prednisolone, or infliximab. The majority of studies reported on primary treatment, so those results are reported below. A limited number of studies investigated secondary or tertiary treatment in IVIG\u2010resistant patients. Doses and regimens of IVIG infusion varied between studies, and all studies had some concerns related to risk of bias. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to ASA for people with KD Compared to ASA treatment, IVIG probably reduces the incidence of CAAs in people with KD up to 30 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.87; 11 studies, 1437 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The individual studies reported a range of adverse effects, but there was little to no difference in numbers of adverse effects between treatment groups (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.89; 10 studies, 1376 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There was limited evidence for the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, so we are uncertain of any effects. Duration of fever days from treatment onset was probably shorter in the IVIG group (mean difference (MD) \u22124.00 days, 95% CI \u22125.06 to \u22122.93; 3 studies, 307 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There was little or no difference between groups in need for additional treatment (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.57; 3 studies, 272 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No study reported length of hospital stay, and no deaths were reported in either group. Primary treatment with IVIG compared to different infusion regimens of IVIG for people with KD Higher\u2010dose regimens of IVIG probably reduce the incidence of CAAs compared to medium\u2010 or lower\u2010dose regimens of IVIG up to 30 days (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89; 8 studies, 1824 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in the number of adverse effects between groups (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.37; 6 studies, 1659 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No study reported on acute coronary syndromes. Higher\u2010dose IVIG may reduce the duration of fever compared to medium\u2010 or lower\u2010dose regimens (MD \u22120.71 days, 95% CI \u22121.36 to \u22120.06; 4 studies, 992 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Higher\u2010dose regimens may reduce the need for additional treatment (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 4 studies, 1125 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). We did not detect a clear difference in length of hospital stay between infusion regimens (MD \u22120.24, 95% CI \u22120.78 to 0.30; 3 studies, 752 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). One study reported mortality, and there was little to no difference detected between regimens (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Primary treatment with IVIG compared to prednisolone for people with KD The evidence comparing IVIG with prednisolone on incidence of CAA is very uncertain (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.48; 2 studies, 140 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), and there was little to no difference between groups in adverse effects (OR 4.18, 95% CI 0.19 to 89.48; 1 study; 90 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). We are very uncertain of the impact on duration of fever, as two studies reported this outcome differently and showed conflicting results. One study reported on acute coronary syndromes and mortality, finding little or no difference between groups (low\u2010certainty evidence). No study reported the need for additional treatment or length of hospital stay. ", "conclusion": " The included RCTs investigated a variety of comparisons, and the small number of events observed during the study periods limited detection of effects. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low due to concerns related to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. The available evidence indicated that high\u2010dose IVIG regimens are probably associated with a reduced risk of CAA formation compared to ASA or medium\u2010 or low\u2010dose IVIG regimens. There were no clinically significant differences in incidence of adverse effects, which suggests there is little concern about the safety of IVIG. Compared to ASA, high\u2010dose IVIG probably reduced the duration of fever, but there was little or no difference detected in the need for additional treatment. Compared to medium\u2010 or low\u2010dose IVIG, there may be reduced duration of fever and reduced need for additional treatment. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding acute coronary syndromes, mortality, or length of hospital stay, or for the comparison IVIG versus prednisolone.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD008106.pub4", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of surgical versus non\u2010surgical interventions for treating people with primary or recurrent patellar dislocation. \n\nMain results:\n We included 10 studies (eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two quasi\u2010RCTs) of 519 participants with patellar dislocation. The mean ages in the individual studies ranged from 13.0 to 27.2 years. Four studies included children, mainly adolescents, as well as adults; two only recruited children. Study follow\u2010up ranged from one to 14 years. We are unsure of the evidence for all outcomes in this review because we judged the certainty of the evidence to be very low. We downgraded each outcome by three levels. Reasons included imprecision (when fewer than 100 events were reported or the confidence interval (CI) indicated appreciable benefits as well as harms), risk of bias (when studies were at high risk of performance, detection and attrition bias), and inconsistency (in the event that pooled analysis included high levels of statistical heterogeneity). We are uncertain whether surgery lowers the risk of recurrent dislocation following primary patellar dislocation compared with non\u2010surgical management at two to nine year follow\u2010up. Based on an illustrative risk of recurrent dislocation in 348 people per 1000 in the non\u2010surgical group, we found that 157 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 209 fewer to 87 fewer) had recurrent dislocation between two and nine years after surgery (8 studies, 438 participants). We are uncertain whether surgery improves patient\u2010rated knee and function scores. Studies measured this outcome using different scales (the Tegner activity scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lysholm, Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score and Hughston visual analogue scale). The most frequently reported score was the Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders score. This indicated people in the surgical group had a mean score of 5.73 points higher at two to nine year follow\u2010up (95% CI 2.91 lower to 14.37 higher; 7 studies, 401 participants). On this 100\u2010point scale, higher scores indicate better function, and a change score of 10 points is considered to be clinically meaningful; therefore, this CI includes a possible meaningful improvement. We are uncertain whether surgery increases the risk of adverse events. Based on an assumed risk of overall incidence of complications during the first two years in 277 people out of 1000 in the non\u2010surgical group, 335 more people per 1000 (95% CI 75 fewer to 723 more) had an adverse event in the surgery group (2 studies, 144 participants). Three studies (176 participants) assessed participant satisfaction at two to nine year follow\u2010up, reporting little difference between groups. Based on an assumed risk of 763 per 1000 non\u2010surgical participants reporting excellent or good outcomes, seven more participants per 1000 (95% CI 199 fewer to 237 more) reported excellent or good satisfaction. Four studies (256 participants) assessed recurrent patellar subluxation at two to nine year follow\u2010up. Based on an assumed risk of patellar subluxation in 292 out of 1000 in the non\u2010surgical group, 73 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 146 fewer to 35 more) had patellar subluxation as a result of surgery. Slightly more people had subsequent surgery in the non\u2010surgical group. Pooled two to nine year follow\u2010up data from three trials (195 participants) indicated that, based on an assumed risk of subsequent surgery in 215 people per 1000 in the non\u2010surgical group, 118 fewer people per 1000 (95% CI 200 fewer to 372 more) had subsequent surgery after primary surgery.

We included four small studies that provided very low\u2010certainty of evidence for the efficacy of corticosteroids in the management of CRF. Further high\u2010quality randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to determine the effectiveness of corticosteroids in this setting. "}

To provide an accurate estimate of the proportion of individuals going on to have further unprovoked seizures at subsequent time points following a single unprovoked epileptic seizure (or cluster of epileptic seizures within a 24\u2010hour period, or a first episode of status epilepticus), of any seizure type (overall prognosis).\u20282. To evaluate the mortality rate following a first unprovoked epileptic seizure. \n\nMain results:\n Fifty\u2010eight studies (involving 54 cohorts), with a total of 12,160 participants (median 147, range 31 to 1443), met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of the 58 studies, 26 studies were paediatric studies, 16 were adult and the remaining 16 studies were a combination of paediatric and adult populations. Most included studies had a cohort study design with two case\u2010control studies and one nested case\u2010control study. Thirty\u2010two studies (29 cohorts) reported a prospective longitudinal design whilst 15 studies had a retrospective design whilst the remaining studies were randomised controlled trials. Nine of the studies included presented mortality data following a first unprovoked seizure. For a mortality study to be included, a proportional mortality ratio (PMR) or a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) had to be given at a specific time point following a first unprovoked seizure. To be included in the meta\u2010analysis a study had to present clear seizure recurrence data at 6 months, 12 months or 24 months. Forty\u2010six studies were included in the meta\u2010analysis, of which 23 were paediatric, 13 were adult, and 10 were a combination of paediatric and adult populations. A meta\u2010analysis was performed at three time points; six months, one year and two years for all ages combined, paediatric and adult studies, respectively. We found an estimated overall seizure recurrence of all included studies at six months of 27% (95% CI 24% to 31%), 36% (95% CI 33% to 40%) at one year and 43% (95% CI 37% to 44%) at two years, with slightly lower estimates for adult subgroup analysis and slightly higher estimates for paediatric subgroup analysis. It was not possible to provide a summary estimate of the risk of seizure recurrence beyond these time points as most of the included studies were of short follow\u2010up and too few studies presented recurrence rates at a single time point beyond two years. The evidence presented was found to be of moderate certainty. ", "conclusion": " Despite the limitations of the data (moderate\u2010certainty of evidence), mainly relating to clinical and methodological heterogeneity we have provided summary estimates for the likely risk of seizure recurrence at six months, one year and two years for both children and adults. This provides information that is likely to be useful for the clinician counselling patients (or their parents) on the probable risk of further seizures in the short\u2010term whilst acknowledging the paucity of long\u2010term recurrence data, particularly beyond 10 years.

Studies enrolled adults, mostly with stage III melanoma, investigated immunotherapies, chemotherapy, or targeted treatments, and compared these with surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment. Duration of follow\u2010up and therapeutic regimens varied, which, combined with heterogeneity in the population and definitions of the endpoints, precluded meta\u2010analysis of all identified studies. We performed a meta\u2010analysis including three studies. We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS when compared to no neoadjuvant treatment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.21; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant treatment may increase the rate of AEs, but the evidence is very uncertain (26% versus 16%, risk ratio (RR) 1.58, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.55; 2 studies, 162 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are very uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases TTR (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.17; 2 studies, 171 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Studies did not report ORR as a comparative outcome or measure QOL data. We are very uncertain whether neoadjuvant targeted treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib increases OS (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or TTR (HR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22; 1 study, 21 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) when compared to surgery. The study did not report comparative rates of AEs and overall response, and did not measure QOL.

We are very uncertain if it increases TTR (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.79; 1 study, 150 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure QOL. OS was not reported for neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) when compared to the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab as adjuvant treatment. There may be little or no difference in the rate of AEs between these treatments (9%, RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 1 study, 20 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The study did not report comparative ORRs or measure TTR and QOL. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (combined ipilimumab and nivolumab) likely results in little to no difference in OS when compared to neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy (P = 0.18; 1 study, 23 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). It may increase the rate of AEs, but the certainty of this evidence is very low (72.8% versus 8.3%, RR 8.73, 95% CI 1.29 to 59; 1 study, 23 participants); this trial was halted early due to observation of disease progression preventing surgical resection in the monotherapy arm and the high rate of treatment\u2010related AEs in the combination arm. Neoadjuvant combination treatment may lead to higher ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (72.8% versus 25%, RR 2.91, 95% CI 1.02 to 8.27; 1 study, 23 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). It likely results in little to no difference in TTR (P = 0.19; 1 study, 23 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The study did not measure QOL.

Only Grade 3 to 4 immune\u2010related AEs were reported; fewer were reported with combination treatment, and the sequential treatment arm closed early due to a high incidence of severe AEs. The neoadjuvant combination likely results in a higher ORR compared to sequential neoadjuvant treatment (60.1% versus 42.3%, RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.32; 1 study, 86 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). The study did not measure TTR and QOL. No data were reported on OS, AEs, TTR, or QOL for the comparison of neoadjuvant interferon (HDI) plus chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant HDI plus chemotherapy may have little to no effect on ORR, but the evidence is very uncertain (33% versus 22%, RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.62 to 4.95; 1 study, 36 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " We are uncertain if neoadjuvant treatment increases OS or TTR compared with no neoadjuvant treatment, and it may be associated with a slightly higher rate of AEs. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of neoadjuvant treatment in clinical practice. Priorities for research include the development of a core outcome set for neoadjuvant trials that are adequately powered, with validation of pathological and radiological responses as intermediate endpoints, to investigate the relative benefits of neoadjuvant treatment compared with adjuvant treatment with immunotherapies or targeted therapies.

Study characteristics and risk of bias \u2028Of the two trials that compared corticosteroid implants with sham procedure, one examined a 0.18 mg FA implant, and the other, a 0.7 mg DEX implant. The other two trials compared a 0.59 mg FA implant with standard\u2010of\u2010care therapy, which included systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications, if needed. We assessed the four trials to be at either low risk, or with some concerns of risk of bias across all domains. Findings \u2028Using sham procedure as control, combined results at the six\u2010month primary time point suggested that corticosteroid implants may decrease the risk of uveitis recurrence by 60% (relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30 to 0.54; 2 trials, 282 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); and lead to a greater improvement in best\u2010corrected visual acuity (BCVA; mean difference [MD] 0.22 logMAR, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.31; 1 trial, 153 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Evidence based on a single\u2010study report (146 participants) suggested that steroid implants may have no effects on visual functioning quality of life, measured on the National Eye Institute 25\u2010Item Visual Function Questionnaire (MD 2.85, 95%CI \u20103.64 to 9.34; 1 trial, 146 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Using standard\u2010of care therapy as control, combined estimates at the 24\u2010month primary time point suggested that corticosteroid implants were likely to decrease the risk of recurrence of uveitis by 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.60; 2 trials, 619 eyes). Combined estimates at 24 months also suggested that steroid implants may have little to no effects on BCVA (MD 0.05 logMAR, 95% CI \u20100.02 to 0.12; 2 trials, 619 eyes; low\u2010certainty evidence).

These implants may increase the risk of elevated intraocular pressure ([IOP] RR 2.81, 95% CI 1.42 to 5.56; 2 trials, 282 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and the need for IOP\u2010lowering eyedrops (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.25; 2 trials, 282 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); but not the need for IOP\u2010lowering surgery (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.17; 2 trials, 282 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

", "conclusion": " Our confidence is limited that local corticosteroid implants are superior to sham therapy or standard\u2010of\u2010care therapy in reducing the risk of uveitis recurrence. We demonstrated different effectiveness on BCVA relative to comparators in people with non\u2010infectious uveitis. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that these implants may increase the risk of cataract progression and IOP elevation, which will require interventions over time.  To better understand the efficacy and safety profiles of corticosteroid implants, we need future trials that examine implants of different doses, used for different durations.

The first study enrolled 110 children (mean age 26.9 \u00b1 14.5 months) with an onset of esotropia before six months of age, and large\u2010angle IE defined as esotropia of \u2265 40 prism diopters. It was conducted between 2015 and 2018 in a tertiary care hospital in South Africa. It compared a maximum of three botulinum toxin injections with surgical intervention of bimedial rectus muscle recession, and children were followed for six months. There were limitations in study design and implementation; the risk of bias was high, or we had some concerns for most domains.  Surgery may increase the incidence of treatment success, defined as orthophoria or residual esotropia of \u2264 10 prism diopters, compared with botulinum toxin injections, but the evidence was very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) of treatment success 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.77; 1 study, 101 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The results should be read with caution because 23 children with > 60 prism diopters at baseline in the surgery arm also received botulinum toxin at the time of surgery to augment the recessions. There was no evidence of an important difference between surgery and botulinum toxin injections for over\u2010correction (> 10 prism diopters) of deviation (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.37; 1 study, 101 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or additional interventions required (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.19; 1 study, 101 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). No major complications of surgery were observed in the surgery arm, while children experienced various complications in the botulinum toxin arm, including partial transient ptosis in 9 (16.7%) children, transient vertical deviation in 3 (5.6%) children, and consecutive exotropia in 13 (24.1%) children. No other outcome data for our prespecified outcomes were reported.  The second study enrolled 124 children with onset of esotropia before one year of age in 12 university hospitals in Germany and the Netherlands. It compared bilateral recession with unilateral recession surgeries, and followed children for three months postoperatively. Very low\u2010certainty evidence suggested that there was no evidence of an important difference between bilateral and unilateral surgeries in the presence of binocular vision (numbers with event unclear, P = 0.35), and over\u2010correction (RR of having exotropia 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.63; 1 study, 118 participants). Dissociated vertical deviation, latent nystagmus, or both were observed in 8% to 21% of participants. ", "conclusion": " Medial rectus recessions may increase the incidence of treatment success compared with botulinum toxin injections alone, but the evidence was very uncertain. No evidence of important difference was found between bilateral surgery and unilateral surgery.  Due to insufficient evidence, it was not possible to resolve the controversies regarding type of surgery, non\u2010surgical intervention, or age of intervention in this review.

One RCT (two studies) was added to this review update. Participants included 99 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 214 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Two RCTs (four studies) included some participants with reduced overall kidney function. The remaining studies either reported that participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were excluded from the study or only included participants with microalbuminuria and normal GFR. Five studies used a parallel study design, and 16 used a cross\u2010over design. Studies were at high risk of bias for most criteria. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were adequate in only three and two studies, respectively. One study was at low risk of bias for blinding of participants and outcome assessment, but no studies were at low risk for selective reporting. Twelve studies reported non\u2010commercial funding sources, three reported conflicts of interest, and eight reported adequate washout between interventions in cross\u2010over studies. The median net reduction in 24\u2010hour urine sodium excretion (24\u2010hour UNa) in seven long\u2010term studies (treatment duration four to 12 weeks) was 76 mmol (range 51 to 124 mmol), and in 10 short\u2010term studies (treatment duration five to seven days) was 187 mmol (range 86 to 337 mmol). Data were only available graphically in four studies. In long\u2010term studies, reduced sodium intake may lower systolic BP (SBP) by 6.15 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI \u20109.27 to \u20103.03; I\u00b2 = 12%), diastolic BP (DBP) by 3.41 mm Hg (7 studies: 95% CI \u20105.56 to \u20101.27; I\u00b2 = 41%) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 4.60 mm Hg (4 studies: 95% CI \u20107.26 to \u20101.94; I\u00b2 = 28%). In short\u2010term studies, low sodium intake may reduce SBP by 8.43 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI \u201014.37 to \u20102.48; I\u00b2 = 88%), DBP by 2.95 mm Hg (5 studies: 95% CI \u20104.96 to \u20100.94; I\u00b2 = 70%) and MAP by 2.37 mm Hg (9 studies: 95% CI \u20104.75 to \u20100.01; I\u00b2 = 65%). There was considerable heterogeneity in most analyses but particularly among short\u2010term studies. All analyses were considered to be of low certainty evidence. SBP, DBP and MAP reductions may not differ between hypertensive and normotensive participants or between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In hypertensive participants, SBP, DBP and MAP may be reduced by 6.45, 3.15 and 4.88 mm Hg, respectively, while in normotensive participants, they may be reduced by 8.43, 2.95 and 2.15 mm Hg, respectively (all low certainty evidence).

Mean age was 46.5 years and 70% were men. Ten studies compared baclofen to placebo or another medication; seven compared two baclofen doses to placebo or another medication. Globally, 15 studies compared baclofen to placebo, two baclofen to acamprosate and two baclofen to naltrexone. In 16 studies, participants received psychosocial treatments. We judged most studies at low risk of selection, performance, detection (subjective outcome), attrition and reporting bias. Ten studies detoxified participants before treatment; in seven studies, participants were still drinking at the beginning of treatment. Treatment duration was 12 weeks for 15 RCTs and longer in two studies. Baclofen daily dose was 30 mg to 300 mg: 10 RCTs used low doses (30 mg or less); eight RCTs medium doses (above 30 and 100 mg or less) and four RCTs high doses (above 100 mg).

This result was confirmed among detoxified participants but not among other subgroups of participants. High\u2010certainty evidence found that baclofen increases the percentage of days abstinent (mean difference (MD) 9.07, 95% CI 3.30 to 14.85; 16 studies, 1273 participants).

There was no difference between baclofen and placebo in the other primary outcomes: heavy drinking days (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.18, 95% CI \u22120.48 to 0.11; 13 studies, 840 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); number of drinks per drinking days (MD \u22120.45, 95% CI \u22121.20 to 0.30; 9 studies, 392 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.11; 10 studies, 738 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; 17 studies, 1563 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 16 studies, 1499 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). These results were confirmed by subgroup analyses except than for the dropouts that resulted lower among participants who received high doses of baclofen and studies longer than 12 weeks. Compared to placebo, there was no difference in craving (SMD \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.37 to 0.04; 17 studies, 1275 participants), anxiety (MD \u22120.01, 95% CI \u22120.14 to 0.11; 15 studies, 1123 participants) and depression (SMD 0.07, 95% CI \u22120.12 to 0.27; 11 studies, 1029 participants). Concerning the specific adverse events, baclofen increases fatigue, dizziness, somnolence/sedation, dry mouth, paraesthesia and muscle spasms/rigidity. There was no difference in the other adverse events. Compared to acamprosate, one study (60 participants) found no differences in any outcomes but the evidence was very uncertain: relapse (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.20; very low\u2010certainty evidence); number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.69; very low\u2010certainty evidence); dropouts (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.46; very low\u2010certainty evidence); dropouts due to adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.87; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and craving (MD 5.80, 95% CI \u221211.84 to 23.44); and all the adverse events evaluated. Compared to naltrexone, baclofen may increase the risk of relapse (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.12 to 5.56; 1 study, 60 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and decrease the number of participants with at least one adverse event (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.80; 2 studies, 80 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (60 participants) found no difference between baclofen and naltrexone in the dropouts at the end of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10; very low\u2010certainty evidence), craving (MD 2.08, 95% CI \u22123.71 to 7.87), and all the adverse events evaluated. ", "conclusion": " Baclofen likely reduces the risk of relapse to any drinking and increases the percentage of abstinent days, mainly among detoxified participants. It does not increase the number of participants with at least one adverse event, those who dropout for any reason or due to adverse events. It probably does not reduce number of heavy drinking days and the number of drinks per drinking days. Current evidence suggests that baclofen may help people with AUD in maintaining abstinence. The results of comparisons of baclofen with acamprosate and naltrexone were mainly based on only one study. "}

HbF inducers versus usual care or placebo; 2. single HbF inducer with another HbF inducer, and single dose with another dose; and 3. combination of HbF inducers versus usual care or placebo, or single HbF inducer. \n\nMain results:\n We included seven RCTs involving 291 people with NTD\u03b2T, aged two to 49 years, from five countries. We reported 10 comparisons using eight different HbF inducers (four pharmacological and four natural): three RCTs compared a single HbF inducer to placebo and seven to another HbF inducer. The duration of the intervention lasted from 56 days to six months. Most studies did not adequately report the randomisation procedures or whether and how blinding was achieved. HbF inducer against placebo or usual care Three HbF inducers, HQK\u20101001, Radix Astragali or a 3\u2010in\u20101 combined natural preparation (CNP), were compared with a placebo. None of the comparisons reported the frequency of blood transfusion. We are uncertain whether Radix Astragali and CNP increase haemoglobin at three months (mean difference (MD) 1.33 g/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 2.11; 1 study, 2 interventions, 35 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether Radix Astragali and CNP have any effect on HbF (MD 12%, 95% CI \u22120.74% to 24.75%; 1 study, 2 interventions, 35 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Only medians on haemoglobin and HbF levels were reported for HQK\u20101001. Adverse effects reported for HQK\u20101001 were nausea, vomiting, dizziness and suprapubic pain. There were no prespecified adverse effects for Radix Astragali and CNP. HbF inducer versus another HbF inducer Four studies compared a single inducer with another over three to six months. Comparisons included hydroxyurea versus resveratrol, hydroxyurea versus thalidomide, hydroxyurea versus decitabine and Radix Astragali versus CNP. No study reported our prespecified outcomes on blood transfusion. Haemoglobin and HbF were reported for the comparison Radix Astragali versus CNP, but we are uncertain whether there were any differences (1 study, 24 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Different doses of the same HbF inducer Two studies compared two different types of HbF inducers at different doses over two to six months. Comparisons included hydroxyurea 20 mg/kg/day versus 10 mg/kg/day and HQK\u20101001 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, 30 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day. Blood transfusion, as prespecified, was not reported. In one study (61 participants) we are uncertain whether the lower levels of both haemoglobin and HbF at 24 weeks were due to the higher dose of hydroxyurea (haemoglobin: MD \u22122.39 g/dL, 95% CI \u22122.80 to \u22121.98; very low\u2010certainty evidence; HbF: MD \u221210.20%, 95% CI \u221216.28% to \u22124.12%; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The study of the four different doses of HQK\u20101001 did not report results for either haemoglobin or HbF. We are not certain if major adverse effects may be more common with higher hydroxyurea doses (neutropenia: risk ratio (RR) 9.93, 95% CI 1.34 to 73.97; thrombocytopenia: RR 3.68, 95% CI 1.12 to 12.07; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Taking HQK\u20101001 20 mg/kg/day may result in the fewest adverse effects. A combination of HbF inducers versus a single HbF inducer Two studies compared three combinations of two inducers with a single inducer over six months: hydroxyurea plus resveratrol versus resveratrol or hydroxyurea alone, and hydroxyurea plus l\u2010carnitine versus hydroxyurea alone. Blood transfusion was not reported. Hydroxyurea plus resveratrol may reduce haemoglobin compared with either resveratrol or hydroxyurea alone (MD \u22120.74 g/dL, 95% CI \u22121.45 to \u22120.03; 1 study, 54 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). We are not certain whether the gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and malaise more commonly reported with hydroxyurea plus resveratrol than resveratrol alone were due to the interventions. We are uncertain whether hydroxyurea plus l\u2010carnitine compared with hydroxyurea alone may increase mean haemoglobin, and reduce pulmonary hypertension (1 study, 60 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Adverse events were reported but not in the intervention group. None of the comparisons reported the outcome of HbF. ", "conclusion": " We are uncertain whether any of the eight HbF inducers in this review have a beneficial effect on people with NTD\u03b2T. For each of these HbF inducers, we found only one or at the most two small studies. There is no information on whether any of these HbF inducers have an effect on our primary outcome, blood transfusion. For the second primary outcome, haemoglobin, there may be small differences between intervention groups, but these may not be clinically meaningful and are of low\u2010 to very low\u2010certainty evidence. Data on adverse effects and optimal doses are limited. Five studies are awaiting classification, but none are ongoing. "}

Secondary objectives were to evaluate compliance with scheduled rehabilitation sessions, abandonment rates for VAE devices, and patient satisfaction ratings. \n\nMain results:\n We identified one RCT/CCT that indirectly met our inclusion criteria, and two ongoing trials that met our inclusion criteria. The included trial had an overall high risk of bias. We did not conduct a quantitative analysis since multiple controlled trials were not identified.  The single included trial of 57 participants utilized a parallel\u2010group design. It compared 30 hours of either personalized low vision training through telerehabilitation with a low vision therapist (the experimental group) with the self\u2010training standard provided by eSight using the eSkills User Guide that was self\u2010administered by the participants at home for one hour per day for 30 days (the comparison group). The trial investigators found a similar direction of effects for both groups for vision\u2010related quality of life and satisfaction at two weeks, three months, and six months. A greater proportion of participants in the comparison group had abandoned or discontinued use of the eSight Eyewear at two weeks than those in the telerehabilitation group, but discontinuance rates were similar between groups at one month and three months. We rated the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes as very low due to high risk of bias in randomization processes and missing outcome data and imprecision.   ", "conclusion": " The included trial found similar efficacy between telerehabilitation with a therapist and an active control intervention of self\u2010guided training in mostly younger to middle\u2010aged adults with low vision who received a new wearable electronic aid.

We categorised three previously included studies and three new studies as 'awaiting classification' based on the research integrity screen.\u2028Five trials used a single bolus dose of vitamin D (300,000 IU in one trial and 100,000 IU in four trials) at the onset of illness or within 24 hours of hospital admission; one used a daily dose of oral vitamin D (1000 IU for children aged up to one year and 2000 IU for children aged over one year) for five days; and one used variable doses (on day 1, 20,000 IU in children younger than six months, 50,000 IU in children aged six to 12 months, and 100,000 IU in children aged 13 to 59 months; followed by 10,000 IU/day for four days or until discharge).

Trial durations ranged from six months to two years. Only two of the studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for all the domains.  Bisphosphonates compared to control in people with cystic fibrosis who have not had a lung transplant Seven trials included only adult participants without lung transplants, one trial included both adults and children without lung transplantation (total of 238 adults and 113 children). We analysed adults (n = 238) and children (n = 113) separately. Adults Three trials assessed intravenous bisphosphonates (one assessed pamidronate and two assessed zoledronate) and five trials assessed oral bisphosphonates (one assessed risedronate and four assessed alendronate). Bisphosphonates were compared to either placebo or calcium (with or without additional vitamin D). Data showed no difference between treatment or control groups in new vertebral fractures at 12 months (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.09; 5 trials, 142 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and two trials (44 participants) reported no vertebral fractures at 24 months.

There was no clear difference in quality of life scores at 12 months (1 trial, 47 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), but bisphosphonates probably led to more adverse events (bone pain) at 12 months (OR 8.49, 95% CI 3.20 to 22.56; 7 trials, 206 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Children The single trial in 113 children compared oral alendronate to placebo. We graded all evidence as low certainty.

Dexamethasone given in different doses Compared to 0.15 mg/kg, 0.60 mg/kg dexamethasone probably reduced the severity of croup as assessed by the croup scoring scale at 24\u2010hour postbaseline score (SMD 0.63, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10; 1 RCT, 72 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); however, this was not the case at two hours (SMD \u22120.27, 95% CI \u22120.76 to 0.22; 2 RCTs, 861 children; high\u2010certainty evidence). There was probably no reduction at six hours (SMD \u22120.45, 95% CI \u22121.26 to 0.35; 3 RCTs, 178 children; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), and the evidence at 12 hours is very uncertain (SMD \u22120.60, 95% CI \u22124.39 to 3.19; 2 RCTs, 113 children; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between doses of dexamethasone in return visits or (re)admissions of children or both (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.17; 3 RCTs, 949 children; high\u2010certainty evidence) or length of stay in the hospital or emergency department (mean difference 0.12, 95% CI \u22120.32 to 0.56; 2 RCTs, 892 children). The need for additional treatments, such as epinephrine (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.75; 2 RCTs, 885 children); intubation (risk difference 0.00, 95% CI \u22120.00 to 0.00; 2 RCTs, 861 children); or use of supplemental glucocorticoids (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.15; 2 RCTs, 617 children), also did not differ between doses of dexamethasone.  There were moderate to high levels of heterogeneity in the analyses for most comparisons. Adverse events were observed for some of the comparisons reported in the review. ", "conclusion": " The evidence that glucocorticoids reduce symptoms of croup at two hours, shorten hospital stays, and reduce the rate of return visits or (re)admissions has not changed in this update. A smaller dose of 0.15 mg/kg of dexamethasone may be as effective as the standard dose of 0.60 mg/kg. More RCTs are needed to strengthen the evidence for effectiveness of low\u2010dose dexamethasone at 0.15 mg/kg to treat croup.  "}

FSS and CTG were compared to CTG alone, and to CTG with fetal blood sampling (FBS). \n\nMain results:\n Two trials, involving 377 women, met the inclusion criteria for this review. Both trials were conducted in hospital settings and included women with singleton, term (37+0 weeks or more) pregnancies, a cephalic presentation, and abnormal CTG. Follow\u2010up was until hospital discharge after the birth. A pilot trial of 50 women in a high\u2010income country (Ireland) compared CTG and digital fetal scalp stimulation (dFSS) with CTG and fetal blood sampling (FBS). A single\u2010centre trial of 327 women in a lower middle\u2010income country (India) compared CTG and manual fetal stimulation (abdominal or vaginal scalp stimulation) with CTG alone. The two included studies were at moderate or unclear risk of bias. Both trials provided clear information on allocation concealment but it was not possible to blind participants or health professionals in relation to the intervention. Although objective outcome measures were reported, outcome assessment was not blinded or blinding was unclear. dFSS and CTG versus FBS and CTG There were no perinatal deaths and data were not reported for neurodevelopmental disability at >/= 12 months. The risk of caesarean section (CS) may be lower with dFSS compared to FBS (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.92; 1 pilot trial, 50 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence) but the evidence is very uncertain. There were no cases of neonatal encephalopathy reported. The evidence was also very uncertain between dFSS and FBS for assisted vaginal birth (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.75; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and for the spontaneous vaginal birth rate (RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.68 to 8.01, very low\u2010certainty evidence). Maternal acceptability of the procedures was not reported. FSS and CTG versus CTG alone Manual stimulation of the fetus was performed either abdominally (92/164) or vaginally (72/164). There were no perinatal deaths and data were not reported for neurodevelopmental disability at >/= 12 months. There may be little differences in the risk of CS on comparing manual fetal stimulation and CTG with CTG alone (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.18; 1 trial, 327 women; very low\u2010certainty evidence), but again the evidence was very uncertain. There were no cases of neonatal encephalopathy reported. There may be no differences in the risk of assisted vaginal birth (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.60; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or in the rates of spontaneous vaginal birth (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21, very low\u2010certainty evidence), but again the evidence is very uncertain. Maternal acceptability of abdominal stimulation/FSS was not reported although 13 women withdrew consent after randomisation due to concerns about fetal well\u2010being.

Evidence was downgraded based on limitations in study design and imprecision. Further high\u2010quality studies of adequate sample size are required to evaluate this research question. In order to be generalisable, these trials should be conducted in different settings, including broad clinical criteria at both preterm and term gestational ages, and standardising the method of stimulation. There is an ongoing study (FIRSST) that will be incorporated into this review in a subsequent update. "}

Four studies evaluated the drug pioglitazone, and one study evaluated rosiglitazone. The participants in different studies were heterogeneous.

Seven studies evaluated balneotherapy versus no treatment, one study evaluated balneotherapy versus a phlebotonic drug ( melilotus officinalis ), and one study evaluated balneotherapy versus dryland exercises. We downgraded our certainty in the evidence due to a lack of blinding of participants and investigators, participant\u2010reported outcomes and imprecision. Balneotherapy versus no treatment Balneotherapy compared to no treatment probably results in slightly improved disease severity signs and symptoms scores as assessed by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS; mean difference (MD) \u22121.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22123.02 to \u22120.49; 3 studies, 671 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

It is unclear if the intervention has an effect at six months (MD \u22122.99, 95% CI \u22126.53 to 0.56; 2 studies, 436 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) or nine months (MD \u22126.40, 95% CI \u221213.84 to 1.04; 1 study, 59 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the occurrence of adverse effects. The main adverse effects were thromboembolic events (odds radio (OR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.42; 3 studies, 584 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), erysipelas (OR 2.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 10.22; 2 studies, 519 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and palpitations (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.52; 1 study, 59 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies reported any serious adverse effects. Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may improve pain scores slightly at three months (MD \u22121.12, 95% CI \u22121.35 to \u22120.88; 2 studies, 354 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); and six months (MD \u22121.02, 95% CI \u22121.25 to \u22120.78; 2 studies, 352 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on oedema (measured by leg circumference) at 24 days to three months, but we are very uncertain about the results (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32 cm, 95% CI \u22120.70 to 1.34; 3 studies, 369 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Balneotherapy compared with no treatment may have little or no effect on the incidence of leg ulcers at 12 months, but we are very uncertain about the results (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.14; 2 studies, 449 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).

No studies reported data on the proportion of participants with progressive visual field loss during follow\u2010up (the primary outcome of this review), mean number of medications to control IOP, or quality of life outcomes.

In subgroup analysis, we divided the RCTs according to the training duration and mean baseline PImax. The test for subgroup differences was not significant. Trials at low risk of bias (n = 3) demonstrated a larger effect estimate than the overall. The summary effect of the  St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)  revealed an overall total score below the MCID of 4 units (MD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.93 to 1.20; 7 RCTs, 908 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

The number of participants per study was small (mean 51, range from 10 to 474). The NMAs on the severity of motor signs and QoL included data from 71 (3196 participants), and 55 (3283 participants) trials, respectively. Eighty\u2010five studies (5192 participants) provided safety data. Here, we present the main results. We observed evidence of beneficial effects for most types of physical exercise included in our review compared to a passive control group. The effects on the severity of motor signs and QoL are expressed as scores on the motor scale of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS\u2010M) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ\u201039), respectively. For both scales, higher scores denote higher symptom burden. Therefore, negative estimates reflect improvement (minimum clinically important difference: \u20102.5 for UPDRS\u2010M and \u20104.72 for PDQ\u201039). Severity of motor signs \u2028The evidence from the NMA (71 studies; 3196 participants) suggests that dance has a moderate beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (mean difference (MD) \u201010.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u201015.54 to \u20104.96; high confidence), and aqua\u2010based, gait/balance/functional, and multi\u2010domain training might have a moderate beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (aqua\u2010based: MD \u20107.77, 95% CI \u201013.27 to \u20102.28; gait/balance/functional: MD \u20107.37, 95% CI \u201011.39 to \u20103.35; multi\u2010domain: MD \u20106.97, 95% CI \u201010.32 to \u20103.62; low confidence). The evidence also suggests that mind\u2010body training and endurance training might have a small beneficial effect on the severity of motor signs (mind\u2010body: MD \u20106.57, 95% CI \u201010.18 to \u20102.81; endurance: MD \u20106.43, 95% CI \u201010.72 to \u20102.28; low confidence).

The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of strength/resistance training and \"Lee Silverman Voice training BIG\" (LSVT BIG) on the severity of motor signs (strength/resistance: MD \u20106.97, 95% CI \u201011.93 to \u20102.01; LSVT BIG: MD \u20105.49, 95% CI \u201014.74 to 3.62; very low confidence). Quality of life \u2028The evidence from the NMA (55 studies; 3283 participants) suggests that aqua\u2010based training probably has a large beneficial effect on QoL (MD \u201014.98, 95% CI \u201023.26 to \u20106.52; moderate confidence). The evidence also suggests that endurance training might have a moderate beneficial effect, and that gait/balance/functional and multi\u2010domain training might have a small beneficial effect on QoL (endurance: MD \u20109.16, 95% CI \u201015.68 to \u20102.82; gait/balance/functional: MD \u20105.64, 95% CI \u201010.04 to \u20101.23; multi\u2010domain: MD \u20105.29, 95% CI \u20109.34 to \u20101.06; low confidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mind\u2010body training, gaming, strength/resistance training, dance, LSVT BIG, and flexibility training on QoL (mind\u2010body: MD \u20108.81, 95% CI \u201014.62 to \u20103.00; gaming: MD \u20107.05, 95% CI \u201018.50 to 4.41; strength/resistance: MD \u20106.34, 95% CI \u201012.33 to \u20100.35; dance: MD \u20104.05, 95% CI \u201011.28 to 3.00; LSVT BIG: MD 2.29, 95% CI \u201016.03 to 20.44; flexibility: MD 1.23, 95% CI \u201011.45 to 13.92; very low confidence). Adverse events \u2028Only 85 studies (5192 participants) provided some kind of safety data, mostly only for the intervention groups. No adverse events (AEs) occurred in 40 studies and no serious AEs occurred in four studies. AEs occurred in 28 studies. The most frequently reported events were falls (18 studies) and pain (10 studies). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of physical exercise on the risk of adverse events (very low confidence). Across outcomes, we observed little evidence of differences between exercise types. ", "conclusion": " We found evidence of beneficial effects on the severity of motor signs and QoL for most types of physical exercise for people with PD included in this review, but little evidence of differences between these interventions. Thus, our review highlights the importance of physical exercise regarding our primary outcomes severity of motor signs and QoL, while the exact exercise type might be secondary. Notably, this conclusion is consistent with the possibility that specific motor symptoms may be treated most effectively by PD\u2010specific programs. Although the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of exercise on the risk of adverse events, the interventions included in our review were described as relatively safe. Larger, well\u2010conducted studies are needed to increase confidence in the evidence. Additional studies recruiting people with advanced disease severity and cognitive impairment might help extend the generalizability of our findings to a broader range of people with PD. "}

Fourteen studies were conducted in nursing homes, three included community residents, one included 'inpatients', one included people from a mental health centre, and one included people from district community centres for older people. Fourteen studies were conducted in the US. We also identified nine ongoing studies. All studies applied one or more non\u2010pharmacological intervention aiming to improve physiological sleep in people with dementia and sleep problems. The most frequently examined single intervention was some form of light therapy (six studies), five studies included physical or social activities, three carer interventions, one daytime sleep restriction, one slow\u2010stroke back massage, and one transcranial electrostimulation. Seven studies examined multimodal complex interventions. Risk of bias of included studies was frequently unclear due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, we rated no study at low risk of bias. We are uncertain whether light therapy has any effect on sleep\u2010related outcomes (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Physical activities may slightly increase the total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency, and may reduce the total time awake at night and slightly reduce the number of awakenings at night (low\u2010certainty evidence). Social activities may slightly increase total nocturnal sleep time and sleep efficiency (low\u2010certainty evidence). Carer interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time, may slightly increase sleep efficiency, and may modestly decrease the total awake time during the night (low\u2010certainty evidence from one study). Multimodal interventions may modestly increase total nocturnal sleep time and may modestly reduce the total wake time at night, but may result in little to no difference in number of awakenings (low\u2010certainty evidence).

We found low\u2010certainty evidence that daytime sleep restrictions, slow\u2010stroke back massage, and transcranial electrostimulation may result in little to no difference in sleep\u2010related outcomes.

Although neither single nor multimodal interventions consistently improved sleep with sufficient certainty, we found some positive effects on physical and social activities as well as carer interventions. Future studies should use rigorous methods to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal interventions using current guidelines on the development and evaluation of complex interventions.

Study sample sizes were 16 and 20 participants. The trials were clinically heterogeneous with differences in causes for scarring (e.g. surgery, infected wounds, and trauma), site (e.g. chest and back), and ages of scars. The duration of follow\u2010up was three and four and a half months. The included studies reported three comparisons; SGS compared with no treatment, SGS compared with non\u2010silicone gel sheeting (a dressing similar to SGS but which does not contain silicone), and SGS compared with intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide. One trial had a split\u2010body design and one trial had an unclear design (resulting in a mix of paired and clustered data). The included studies reported limited outcome data for the primary review outcome of scar severity measured by health professionals and no data were reported for severity of scar measured by patients or adverse events. For secondary outcomes some data on pain were reported, but health\u2010related quality of life and cost\u2010effectiveness were not reported. Both trials had suboptimal outcome reporting, thus many domains in the risk of bias were assessed as unclear. All evidence was rated as being very low\u2010certainty, mainly due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision.  SGS compared with no treatment Two studies with 33 participants (76 scars) reported the severity of scar assessed by health professionals, and we are uncertain about the effect of SGS on scar severity compared with no treatment (very low\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). We are uncertain about the effect of SGS on pain compared with no treatment (21 participants with 40 scars; very low\u2010certainty evidence, downgraded once for risk of bias, once for inconsistency, once for indirectness, and once for imprecision). No data were reported for other outcomes including scar severity assessed by patients, adverse events, adherence to treatment, health\u2010related quality of life and cost\u2010effectiveness.

From the two studies identified, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether the use of SGS compared with no treatment, non\u2010SGS, or intralesional injections of triamcinolone acetonide makes any difference in the treatment of keloid scars. Evidence from the included studies is of very low certainty, mainly driven by the risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision due to small sample size.

Moreover, the effect of LPD on adverse events (e.g. malnutrition, hyperglycaemic events, or health\u2010related quality of life (HRQoL)) and compliance were also evaluated. \n\nMain results:\n We identified eight studies involving 486 participants with DKD. The prescribed protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg/day. The prescribed protein intake in the control groups was \u2265 1.0 g/kg/day, or a calculated protein intake \u2265 1.0 g/kg/day if data on prescribed protein intake were not provided. The mean duration of the interventions was two years (ranging from one to five years). Risks of bias in most of the included studies were high or unclear, most notably for allocation concealment, performance and detection bias. All studies were considered to be at high risk for performance bias due to the nature of the interventions. Most studies were not designed to examine death or kidney failure. In low certainty evidence, a LPD may have little or no effect on death (5 studies, 358 participants: RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.44; I\u00b2 = 0%), and the number of participants who reached kidney failure (4 studies, 287 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.59; I\u00b2 = 0%). Compared to a usual or unrestricted protein intake, it remains uncertain whether a LPD slows the decline of glomerular filtration rate over time (7 studies, 367 participants: MD \u20100.73 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2/year, 95% CI \u20102.3 to 0.83; I\u00b2 = 53%; very low certainty evidence).

There was only one study reporting 24\u2010hour urinary protein excretion. In very low certainty evidence, a LPD had uncertain effects on the annual change in proteinuria (1 study, 80 participants: MD 0.90 g/24 hours, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.31). There was no evidence of malnutrition in seven studies, while one study noted this condition in the LPD group. Participant compliance with a LPD was unsatisfactory in nearly half of the studies. One study reported LPD had no effect on HRQoL. No studies reported hyperglycaemic events. ", "conclusion": " Dietary protein restriction has uncertain effects on changes in kidney function over time. However, it may make little difference to the risk of death and kidney failure. Questions remain about protein intake levels and compliance with protein\u2010restricted diets.

Study participants' mean age was 72.2 years (interquartile range [IQR] 68.8 to 73.6) and 72% were women (IQR 69% to 74%). Three trials included participants with acute CME, and four included participants with chronic CME; the remaining two trials enrolled both participants with acute and chronic CME or participants with unknown CME duration. We assessed trials as having unclear (33%) or high risk of bias (67%). Visual improvement of two or more lines at the end of treatment  Data from one trial in participants with acute CME show no treatment effect of topical ketorolac compared to placebo (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 8.76; 22 participants). Data from a three\u2010arm trial in participants with acute CME demonstrate that, when compared with topical prednisolone, topical ketorolac (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.58 to 3.07; 17 participants) or topical ketorolac and prednisolone combination therapy (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.69; 17 participants) may have little or no effect on visual improvement. Results of subgroup analysis from two studies in participants with chronic CME suggest that, after treatment for 90 days or longer, NSAIDs may increase participants' likelihood of visual improvement by 1.87 fold (RR 2.87, 95% CI 1.58 to 5.22; I 2  = 33%; 2 trials, 121 participants) relative to placebo.

Overall, this evidence is very low certainty.  A single\u2010study estimate in patients with mixed CME indicates that topical diclofenac may increase the likelihood of visual improvement by 40% when compared to topical ketorolac (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.94; 68 participants). However, the same trial reported no difference between the groups in mean final visual acuity in Snellen lines (MD 0.40, 95% CI \u22120.93 to 1.73). A three\u2010arm trial in patients with mixed CME reporting visual changes in ETDRS letters in comparisons between ketorolac and diclofenac (34 participants) or bromfenac (34 participants) suggests no evidence of effects. Overall, NSAIDs may slightly improve visual acuity in participants with mixed CME but the evidence is very uncertain. Persistence of improvement of vision one month after discontinuation of treatment One trial of participants with chronic CME tested oral indomethacin (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.60; 20 participants) and the other compared topical ketorolac to placebo (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 31.1; 26 participants).

None of the trials in patients with acute or mixed CME reported this outcome. Proportion of participants with improvement in leakage on fundus fluorescein angiography One three\u2010arm trial in participants with acute CME shows that, when compared with topical prednisolone, there is no treatment benefit of topical ketorolac (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.75; 17 participants) or topical ketorolac and topical prednisolone combination therapy (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.38; 17 participants).

Neither of the trials in patients with mixed CME reported this outcome.

One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three\u2010week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow\u2010up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA\u2010negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low\u2010certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low\u2010certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low\u2010certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low\u2010certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low\u2010certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low\u2010certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations.  ", "conclusion": " Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA\u2010negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow\u2010up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA\u2010negative. Moreover, the longer\u2010term clinical consequences \u2013 in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care \u2013 remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open\u2010label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

There were 1270 mother\u2013child dyads and 1924 children aged less than five years recruited. Seven studies were from the USA, two from New Zealand, one from Canada, and one delivered in both Australia and New Zealand. The focus of interventions varied and included three studies focused on early childhood caries; three on childhood obesity; two on child behavioural problems; and one each on negative parenting patterns, child acute respiratory illness, and sudden unexpected death in infancy. Family\u2010centred education was the most common type of intervention delivered. Three studies compared family\u2010centred care to usual care and seven studies provided some 'minimal' intervention to families such as education in the form of pamphlets or newsletters. One study provided a minimal intervention during the child's first 24 months and then the family\u2010centred care intervention for one year. No studies had low or unclear risk of bias across all domains. All studies had a high risk of bias for the blinding of participants and personnel domain. Family\u2010centred care may improve overall health and well\u2010being of Indigenous children and their families, but the evidence was very uncertain. The pooled effect estimate from 11 studies suggests that family\u2010centred care improved the overall health and well\u2010being of Indigenous children and their families compared no family\u2010centred care (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.24; 2386 participants). We are very uncertain whether family\u2010centred care compared to no family\u2010centred care improves the psychological health and emotional behaviour of children as measured by the Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) (Competence domain) (mean difference (MD) 0.04, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.11; 2 studies, 384 participants). We assessed the evidence as being very uncertain about the effect of family\u2010centred care on physical health and developmental health outcomes of children. Pooled data from eight trials on physical health and developmental outcomes found there was little to no difference between the intervention and the control groups (SMD 0.13, 95% CI \u22120.00 to 0.26; 1961 participants). The evidence is also very unclear whether family\u2010centred care improved family\u2010enhancing lifestyle and behaviours outcomes. Nine studies measured family health\u2010enhancing lifestyle and behaviours and pooled analysis found there was little to no difference between groups (SMD 0.16, 95% CI \u22120.06 to 0.39; 1969 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There was very low\u2010certainty evidence of little to no difference for the psychological health of parents and carers when they participated in family\u2010centred care compared to any control group (SMD 0.10, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.22; 5 studies, 975 parents/carers). Two studies stated that there were no adverse events as a result of the intervention. No additional data were provided. No studies reported from the health service providers perspective or on outcomes for family's evaluation of care or family\u2010centredness of consultation processes. ", "conclusion": " There is some evidence to suggest that family\u2010centred care delivered by primary healthcare services improves the overall health and well\u2010being of Indigenous children, parents, and families. However, due to lack of data, there was not enough evidence to determine whether specific outcomes such as child health and development improved as a result of family\u2010centred interventions. Seven of the 11 studies delivered family\u2010centred education interventions. Seven studies were from the USA and centred on two particular trials, the 'Healthy Children, Strong Families' and 'Family Spirit' trials. As the evidence is very low certainty for all outcomes, further high\u2010quality trials are needed to provide robust evidence for the use of family\u2010centred care interventions for Indigenous children aged less than five years.

All studies focused on upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), with only one study including some lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). Six treatment studies examined the effect on URTI recovery, and five studies investigated the effect on preventing URTIs after one to four months of treatment. Two treatment and three prevention studies involved homeopaths individualising treatment. The other studies used predetermined, non\u2010individualised treatments. All studies involved highly diluted homeopathic medicinal products, with dilutions ranging from 1 x 10 \u20104  to 1 x 10 \u2010200 . We identified several limitations to the included studies, in particular methodological inconsistencies and high attrition rates, failure to conduct intention\u2010to\u2010treat analysis, selective reporting, and apparent protocol deviations. We assessed three studies as at high risk of bias in at least one domain, and many studies had additional domains with unclear risk of bias. Four studies received funding from homeopathy manufacturers; one study support from a non\u2010government organisation; two studies government support; one study was co\u2010sponsored by a university; and three studies did not report funding support. Methodological inconsistencies and significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity precluded robust quantitative meta\u2010analysis. Only four outcomes were common to more than one study and could be combined for analysis. Odds ratios (OR) were generally small with wide confidence intervals (CI), and the contributing studies found conflicting effects, so there was little certainty that the efficacy of the intervention could be ascertained. All studies assessed as at low risk of bias showed no benefit from oral homeopathic medicinal products, whilst trials at unclear or high risk of bias reported beneficial effects. For the comparison of individualised homeopathy versus placebo or usual care for the prevention of ARTIs, two trials reported on disease severity; due to heterogeneity the data were not combined, but neither study demonstrated a clinically significant difference. We combined data from two trials for the outcome need for antibiotics (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.76; low\u2010certainty evidence). For the comparison of non\u2010individualised homeopathy versus placebo or usual care for the prevention of ARTIs, only the outcome recurrence of ARTI was reported by more than one trial; data from three studies were combined for this outcome (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.72; low\u2010certainty evidence). For the comparison of both individualised and non\u2010individualised homeopathy versus placebo or usual care for the treatment of ARTIs, two studies provided data on short\u2010term cure (OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 19.54) and long\u2010term cure (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.96; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The studies demonstrated an opposite direction of effect for both outcomes. Six studies reported on disease severity but were not combined as they used different scoring systems and scales. Three studies reported adverse events (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.16 to 4.03; low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " Pooling of five prevention and six treatment studies did not show any consistent benefit of homeopathic medicinal products compared to placebo on ARTI recurrence or cure rates in children. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as low to very low for the majority of outcomes. We found no evidence to support the efficacy of homeopathic medicinal products for ARTIs in children. Adverse events were poorly reported, and we could not draw conclusions regarding safety. "}

We judged 10 studies at low risk of bias, 17 at high risk of bias and 20 at unclear risk of bias. Only two studies reported data on tooth extraction.

There were 160 males and 179 females ranging in age from 13 to 67 years. The trials used different laser photocoagulation techniques; one single\u2010centre trial employed sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation using an argon laser; a two\u2010centre trial employed feeder vessel coagulation using argon laser in one centre and xenon arc in the second centre; while a third trial employed focal scatter laser photocoagulation using argon laser. The mean follow\u2010up periods were 21 to 32 months in one trial, 42 to 47 months in a second, and 48 months in the third. Two trials had a high risk of allocation bias due to the randomisation method for participants with bilateral disease; the third trial had an unclear risk of selection bias. One trial was at risk of reporting bias. Given the unit of analysis is the eye rather than the individual, we chose to report the data narratively. Using sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation, one trial (174 eyes) reported no difference between groups for complete regression of PSR: 30.2% in the laser group and 22.4% in the control group. The same trial also reported no difference between groups in the development of new PSR: 34.3% of lasered eyes and 41.3% of control eyes (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The two\u2010centre trial using feeder vessel coagulation, only presented data at follow\u2010up for one centre (mean period of nine years) and reported the development of new sea fan in 48.0% in the treated and 45.0% in the control group; no statistical significance (P = 0.64). A third trial reported regression in 55% of the laser group versus 28.6% of controls and progression of PSR in 10.5% of treated versus 25.7% of control eyes. We graded the evidence for these two primary outcomes as very low\u2010certainty evidence. The sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported visual loss in 3.0% of treated eyes (mean follow\u2010up 47 months) versus 12.0% of controlled eyes (mean follow\u2010up 42 months) (P = 0.019). The feeder vessel coagulation trial reported visual loss in 1.14% of the laser group and 7.5% of the control group (mean follow\u2010up 26 months at one site and 32 months in another) (P = 0.07). The focal scatter laser photocoagulation trial (mean follow\u2010up of four years) reported that 72/73 eyes had the same visual acuity, while visual loss was seen in only one eye from the control group. We graded the certainty of the evidence as very low. The sectoral scatter laser trial detected vitreous haemorrhage in 12.0% of the laser group and 25.3% of control with a mean follow\u2010up of 42 (control) to 47 months (treated) (P \u2264 0.5). The two\u2010centre feeder vessel coagulation trial observed vitreous haemorrhage in 3.4% treated eyes (mean follow\u2010up 26 months) versus 27.5% control eyes (mean follow\u2010up 32 months); one centre (mean follow\u2010up nine years) reported vitreous haemorrhage in 1/25 eyes (4.0%) in the treatment group and 9/20 eyes (45.0%) in the control group (P = 0.002). The scatter laser photocoagulation trial reported that vitreous haemorrhage was not seen in the treated group compared to 6/35 (17.1%) eyes in the control group and appeared only in the grades B and (PSR) stage III) (P < 0.05). We graded evidence for this outcome as low\u2010certainty. Regarding adverse effects, only one occurrence of retinal tear was reported. All three trials reported on retinal detachment, with no significance across the treatment and control groups (low\u2010certainty evidence). One trial reported on choroidal neovascularization, with treatment with xenon arc found to be associated with a significantly higher risk, but visual loss related to this complication is uncommon with long\u2010term follow\u2010up of three years or more. The included trials did not report on other adverse effects or quality of life. ", "conclusion": " Our conclusions are based on the data from three trials (two of which were conducted over 30 years ago). Given the limited evidence available, which we assessed to be of low\u2010 or very low\u2010certainty, we are uncertain whether laser therapy for sickle cell retinopathy improves the outcomes measured in this review. This treatment does not appear to have an effect on clinical outcomes such as regression of PSR and development of new incidences. No evidence is available assessing efficacy in relation to patient\u2010important outcomes (such as quality of life or the loss of a driving licence).  Further research is needed to examine the safety of laser treatment compared to other interventions such as intravitreal injection of anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) .

Our secondary objectives were: to compare the accuracy of BNP and NT\u2010proBNP; and to explore possible sources of heterogeneity among studies evaluating BNP and NT\u2010proBNP, including type of commercial assay, chronological age of the infant at testing, gestational age at birth, whether used to initiate medical or surgical treatment, test threshold, and criteria of the reference standard (type of echocardiographic parameter used for diagnosis, clinical symptoms or physical signs if data were available). \n\nMain results:\n We included 34 studies: 13 evaluated BNP and 21 evaluated NT\u2010proBNP in the diagnosis of hsPDA. Studies varied by methodological quality, type of commercial assay, thresholds, age at testing, gestational age and whether the assay was used to initiate medical or surgical therapy. We noted some variability in the definition of hsPDA among the included studies. For BNP, the summary curve is reported in the ROC space (13 studies, 768 infants, low\u2010certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (83%), lower and upper quartiles (79% and 92%) were 93.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77.8 to 98.4), 95.5% (95% CI 83.6 to 98.9) and 81.1% (95% CI 50.6 to 94.7), respectively. Subgroup comparisons revealed differences by type of assay and better diagnostic accuracy at lower threshold cut\u2010offs (< 250 pg/ml compared to \u2265 250 pg/ml), testing at gestational age < 30 weeks and chronological age at testing at one to three days. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the BNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA. For NT\u2010proBNP, the summary ROC curve is reported in the ROC space (21 studies, 1459 infants, low\u2010certainty evidence). The estimated specificities from the ROC curve at fixed values of sensitivities at median (92%), lower and upper quartiles (85% and 94%) were 83.6% (95% CI 73.3 to 90.5), 90.6% (95% CI 83.8 to 94.7) and 79.4% (95% CI 67.5 to 87.8), respectively. Subgroup analyses by threshold (< 6000 pg/ml and \u2265 6000 pg/ml) did not reveal any differences. Subgroup analysis by mean gestational age (< 30 weeks vs 30 weeks and above) showed better accuracy with < 30 weeks, and chronological age at testing (days one to three vs over three) showed testing at days one to three had better diagnostic accuracy. Data were insufficient for subgroup analysis of whether the NTproBNP testing was indicated for medical or surgical management of PDA. We performed meta\u2010regression for BNP and NT\u2010proBNP using the covariates: assay type, threshold, mean gestational age and chronological age; none of the covariates significantly affected summary sensitivity and specificity.

Three studies with a total of 143 participants compared LHC + Dor to LHC without fundoplication. We found that the evidence is very uncertain as to whether the addition of a Dor fundoplication made any difference to the outcome of postoperative pathological acid reflux (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.89; I 2  = 56%; 2 studies, 97 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and uncertain for severe postoperative dysphagia (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.34 to 26.33; I 2  = 0%; 3 studies, 142 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

To compare effects and complications against the current gold surgical standard (direct repair or nerve autograft). \n\nMain results:\n Five studies involving 213 participants and 257 nerve injuries reconstructed with wraps or conduits (129 participants) or standard repair (128 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Of those in the standard repair group, 119 nerve injuries were managed with direct epineurial repair, and nine autologous nerve grafts were performed. One study excluded the outcome data for the repair using an autologous nerve graft from their analysis, as it was the only autologous nerve graft in the study, so data were available for 127 standard repairs. There was variation in the functional outcome measures reported and the time postoperatively at which they were recorded. Mean sensory recovery, assessed with BMRC sensory grading (range S0 to S4, higher score considered better) was 0.03 points higher in the device group (range 0.43 lower to 0.49 higher; 1 RCT, 28 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) than in the standard repair group (mean 2.75 points), which suggested little or no difference between the groups, but the evidence is very uncertain. There may be little or no difference at 24 months in mean touch thresholds between standard repair (0.81) and repair using devices, which was 0.01 higher but this evidence is also very uncertain (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 lower to 0.08 higher; 1 trial, 32 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Data were not available to assess BMRC motor grading at 24 months or more. Repair using bioengineered devices may not improve integrated functional outcome scores at 24 months more than standard techniques, as assessed by the Ros\u00e9n Model Instrument (RMI; range 0 to 3, higher scores better); the CIs allow for both no important difference and a better outcome with standard repair (mean RMI 1.875), compared to the device group (0.17 lower, 95% CI 0.38 lower to 0.05 higher; P = 0.13; 2 trials, 60 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Data from one study suggested that the five\u2010year postoperative outcome of RMI may be slightly improved after repair using a device (mean difference (MD) 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 1 trial, 28 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies measured impact on daily living using DASH\u2010PROM. The proportion of people with adverse events may be greater with nerve wraps or conduits than with standard techniques, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 7.15, 95% CI 1.74 to 29.42; 5 RCTs, 213 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). This corresponds to 10 adverse events per 1000 people in the standard repair group and 68 per 1000 (95% CI 17 to 280) in the device group. The use of nerve repair devices may be associated with a greater need for revision surgery but this evidence is also very uncertain (12/129 device repairs required revision surgery (removal) versus 0/127 standard repairs; RR 7.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 39.02; 5 RCTs, 256 nerve repairs; very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " Based on the available evidence, this review does not support use of currently available nerve repair devices over standard repair. There is significant heterogeneity in participants, injury pattern, repair timing, and outcome measures and their timing across studies of nerve repair using bioengineered devices, which make comparisons unreliable. Studies were generally small and at high or unclear risk of bias. These factors render the overall certainty of evidence for any outcome low or very low. The data reviewed here provide some evidence that more people may experience adverse events with use of currently available bioengineered devices than with standard repair techniques, and the need for revision surgery may also be greater. The evidence for sensory recovery is very uncertain and there are no data for muscle strength at 24 months (our primary outcome measures). We need further trials, adhering to a minimum standard of outcome reporting (with at least 12 months' follow\u2010up, including integrated sensorimotor evaluation and patient\u2010reported outcomes) to provide high\u2010certainty evidence and facilitate more detailed analysis of effectiveness of emerging, increasingly sophisticated, bioengineered repair devices.

Twenty\u2010nine RCTs provided results for individuals aged over 60 years, and three RCTs included immunocompromized patients. No trials included pregnant women. Sixteen RCTs had two\u2010month follow\u2010up or less, 20 RCTs had two to six months, and five RCTs had greater than six to 12 months or less. Eighteen reports were based on preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with results not yet available.  This abstract reports results for the  critical outcomes  of confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019, severe and critical COVID\u201019, and serious adverse events only for the 10 WHO\u2010approved vaccines. For remaining outcomes and vaccines, see main text. The evidence for mortality was generally sparse and of low or very low certainty for all WHO\u2010approved vaccines, except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces the risk of all\u2010cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence).

Moderate\u2010certainty evidence found that NVX\u2010CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic COVID\u201019 compared to placebo (VE 82.91%, 95% CI 50.49% to 94.10%; 3 RCTs, 42,175 participants). There is low\u2010certainty evidence for CoronaVac (Sinovac) for this outcome (VE 69.81%, 95% CI 12.27% to 89.61%; 2 RCTs, 19,852 participants). Severe or critical COVID\u201019 High\u2010certainty evidence found that BNT162b2, mRNA\u20101273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 result in a large reduction in incidence of severe or critical disease due to COVID\u201019 compared to placebo (VE: BNT162b2: 95.70%, 95% CI 73.90% to 99.90%; 1 RCT, 46,077 participants; mRNA\u20101273: 98.20%, 95% CI 92.80% to 99.60%; 1 RCT, 28,451 participants; AD26.COV2.S: 76.30%, 95% CI 57.90% to 87.50%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBV152: 93.40%, 95% CI 57.10% to 99.80%; 1 RCT, 16,976 participants).

Two trials reported high efficacy of CoronaVac for severe or critical disease with wide CIs, but these results could not be pooled. Serious adverse events (SAEs) mRNA\u20101273, ChAdOx1 (Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca)/SII\u2010ChAdOx1 (Serum Institute of India), Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference in SAEs compared to placebo (RR: mRNA\u20101273: 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08; 2 RCTs, 34,072 participants; ChAdOx1/SII\u2010ChAdOx1: 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; 7 RCTs, 58,182 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants); BBV152: 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 25,928 participants). In each of these, the likely absolute difference in effects was fewer than 5/1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP\u2010CorV, and NVX\u2010CoV2373 compared to placebo (RR: BNT162b2: 1.30, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.07; 2 RCTs, 46,107 participants; CoronaVac: 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 23,139 participants; BBIBP\u2010CorV: 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.06; 1 RCT, 26,924 participants; NVX\u2010CoV2373: 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 38,802 participants).

", "conclusion": " Compared to placebo, most vaccines reduce, or likely reduce, the proportion of participants with confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019, and for some, there is high\u2010certainty evidence that they reduce severe or critical disease. There is probably little or no difference between most vaccines and placebo for serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs are evaluating the efficacy of COVID\u201019 vaccines, and this review is updated regularly on the COVID\u2010NMA platform ( covid-nma.com ). Implications for practice Due to the trial exclusions, these results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with a history of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, or immunocompromized people. Most trials had a short follow\u2010up and were conducted before the emergence of variants of concern. Implications for research Future research should evaluate the long\u2010term effect of vaccines, compare different vaccines and vaccine schedules, assess vaccine efficacy and safety in specific populations, and include outcomes such as preventing long COVID\u201019. Ongoing evaluation of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against emerging variants of concern is also vital.  "}

High\u2010dose triple therapy is likely superior to MD triple therapy in reducing steroid\u2010requiring asthma exacerbations. Triple therapy is unlikely to result in clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms or quality of life compared to dual therapy considering the MCIDs. High\u2010dose triple therapy, but not MD triple, results in a reduction in all\u2010cause AEs and likely reduces dropouts due to AEs compared to MD\u2010ICS/LABA.

Cervical pessary versus no treatment Cervical pessary compared with no treatment may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.55; 5 studies, 1830 women; low\u2010certainty evidence) or before 37 weeks (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.05; 5 studies, 1830 women; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, these results should be viewed with caution because the 95% CIs cross the line of no effect. Cervical pessary compared with no treatment probably has little or no effect on the risk of maternal infection or inflammation (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.26; 2 studies, 1032 women; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an effect on neonatal/paediatric care unit admission (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.59; 3 studies, 1332 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence) or fetal/neonatal mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.48; 5 studies, 1830 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence) because the 95% CIs are compatible with a wide range of effects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm. Cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone Cervical pessary may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.02; 3 studies, 1126 women; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or before 37 weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; 3 studies, 1126 women; moderate\u2010certainty evidence), but we are uncertain of the results because the 95% CI crosses the line of no effect. The intervention probably has little or no effect on maternal infection or inflammation (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; 2 studies, 265 women; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with vaginal progesterone has an effect on the risk of neonatal/paediatric care unit admission (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.98; low\u2010certainty evidence) or fetal/neonatal mortality (RR 1.97, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.70; 2 studies; 265 infants; low\u2010certainty evidence) because the 95% CIs are compatible with a wide range of effects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm. Cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage Only one very small study of 13 pregnant women contributed data to this comparison; the results were unclear. ", "conclusion": " In women with a singleton pregnancy, cervical pessary compared with no treatment or vaginal progesterone may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks, although these results should be viewed with caution due to uncertainty around the effect estimates. There is insufficient evidence with regard to the effect of cervical pessary compared with cervical cerclage on PTB. Due to low certainty\u2010evidence in many of the prespecified outcomes and non\u2010reporting of several other outcomes of interest for this review, there is a need for further robust RCTs that use standardised terminology for maternal and offspring outcomes. Future trials should take place in a range of settings to improve generalisability of the evidence. Further research should concentrate on comparisons of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage and bed rest. Investigation of different phenotypes of PTB may be relevant. "}

Six studies (1516 participants) were conducted in Japan and one study (53 participants) in China. Studies included both male and female participants with colorectal cancer (five studies), colon cancer (one study) or rectal cancer (one study). Participants were diagnosed with cancer ranging from stage II to stage IV.  Coriolus  was used in the form of an extract in all seven studies and was generally used after curative resection, although in one study it was used preoperatively. Duration of treatment with the extract varied between four weeks and three years. Chemotherapeutic regimens in six studies consisted of an oral fluoropyrimidine which was preceded by weekly intravenous 5\u2010Fluorouracil (5\u2010FU) in one study, by mitomycin C in two studies, and which was combined with folinic acid (Leucovorin) in two studies and with radiotherapy preoperatively in one study. XELOX (oxaliplatin intravenous infusion and capecitabine) was used in the remaining study. We found very low\u2010certainty evidence of little to no effect of adjunctive treatment with  Coriolus  (in the form of an extract, polysaccharide\u2010Krestin, PSK) on withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events  (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 2.34; 703 participants; 3 studies;). We are uncertain whether adjunctive  Coriolus versicolor  and its extracts compared to usual care alone resulted in a difference in adverse events including neutropenia (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.71; 133 participants; 3 studies; very low certainty), oral cavity disorders such as oral dryness and mucositis (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.03; 1022 participants; 5 studies; very low certainty), nausea (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.22; 969 participants; 4 studies; very low certainty), diarrhoea (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.86; 1022 participants; 5 studies; very low certainty), and fatigue (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.33 to 1.78; 133 participants; 3 studies; very low certainty).

", "conclusion": " Due to the very low certainty of evidence, we were uncertain about the effect of adjunctive  Coriolus  (in the form of an extract PSK) on adverse events resulting from conventional chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. This includes effects on withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events and on specific adverse outcomes such as neutropenia and nausea. The uncertainty in the evidence also means that it was unclear whether any adverse events were due to the chemotherapy or to the extract itself. While there was low\u2010certainty evidence of a small effect on overall survival at five years, the influence of reduced adverse effects on this could not be determined. In addition, chemotherapy regimens used in assessing this outcome do not reflect current preferred practice. "}

Included studies only enroled participants at high risk of FN (e.g. people with haematological malignancy); none of them included participants at low risk (e.g. people with solid tumours).  Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be little to no difference between pre\u2010emptive and empirical antifungal treatment for all\u2010cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 1.30; absolute effect, reduced by 3/1000); and for mortality ascribed to fungal infection (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.89; absolute effect, reduced by 2/1000).

Six were from the original version of the review, and two more were added when the search was updated. Nineteen further studies were assessed as part of this update but did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Of the eight included studies, four studies investigated \u201cprevention\u201d of cognitive problems (during radiotherapy and follow\u2010up) and four studies investigated \u201camelioration\u201d (interventions to treat cognitive impairment as a late complication of radiotherapy). There were five pharmacological studies (two studies on prevention and three in amelioration) and three non\u2010pharmacological studies (two on prevention and one in amelioration). Due to differences between studies in the interventions being evaluated, a meta\u2010analysis was not possible.  Studies in early radiotherapy treatment phase (five studies) Pharmacological studies in the \u201cearly radiotherapy treatment phase\u201d were designed to prevent or ameliorate cognitive deficits and included drugs used in dementia (memantine) and fatigue (d\u2010threo\u2010methylphenidate hydrochloride). Non\u2010pharmacological studies in the \u201cearly radiotherapy treatment phase\u201d included a ketogenic diet and a two\u2010week cognitive rehabilitation and problem\u2010solving programme.  In the memantine study, the primary cognitive outcome of memory at six months did not reach significance, but there was significant improvement in overall cognitive function compared to placebo, with similar adverse events across groups. The d\u2010threo\u2010methylphenidate hydrochloride study found no statistically significant difference between arms, with few adverse events. The study of a calorie\u2010restricted ketogenic diet found no effect, although a lower than expected calorie intake in the control group complicates interpretation of the results.  The study investigating the utility of a rehabilitation program did not carry out a statistical comparison of cognitive performance between groups.  Studies in delayed radiation or late effect phase (four studies) The \u201camelioration\u201d pharmacological studies to treat cognitive complications of radiotherapy included drugs used in dementia (donepezil) or psychostimulants (methylphenidate and modafinil). Non\u2010pharmacological measures included cognitive rehabilitation and problem solving (Goal Management Training). These studies included patients with cognitive problems at entry who had \u201cstable\u201d brain cancer.  The donepezil study did not find an improvement in the primary cognitive outcome of overall cognitive performance, but did find improvement in an individual test of memory, compared to placebo; adverse events were not reported. A study comparing methylphenidate with modafinil found improvements in cognitive function in both the methylphenidate and modafinil arms; few adverse events were reported. Another  study comparing two different doses of modafinil combined treatment arms and found improvements across all cognitive tests, however, a number of adverse events were reported. Both studies were limited by a small sample size. The Goal Management Training study suggested a benefit of the intervention, a behavioural intervention that combined mindfulness and strategy training, on executive function and processing speed.  There were a number of limitations across studies and few were without high risks of bias.

As concluded in the original review, there is supportive evidence that memantine may help prevent cognitive deficits for adults with brain metastases receiving cranial irradiation. There is supportive evidence that donepezil, methylphenidate and modafinil may have a role in treating cognitive deficits in adults with brain tumours who have been treated with cranial irradiation; patient withdrawal affected the statistical power of these studies. Further research that tries to minimise the withdrawal of consent, and subsequently reduce the requirement for imputation procedures, may offer a higher certainty of evidence. There is evidence from only a single small study to support non\u2010pharmacological interventions in the amelioration of cognitive deficits. Further research is required. "}

The median study sample size was 60 participants (ranging from 18 to 466 participants) and length was 37 weeks (ranging from 12 weeks to 2 years). There were variations in the dose reduction strategies in terms of speed of reduction (i.e. gradual in about half of the studies (within 2 to 16 weeks) and abrupt in the other half), and in terms of degree of reduction (i.e. median planned reduction of 66% of the dose up to complete withdrawal in three studies). We assessed risk of bias across outcomes predominantly as some concerns or high risk.  No study reported data on the number of participants with a clinically important change in quality of life or functioning, and only eight studies reported continuous data on scales measuring quality of life or functioning.

High certainty evidence showed early KRT initiation increased the risk of hypophosphataemia (1 study, 2927 participants: RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.44), hypotension (5 studies, 3864 participants: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.85; I\u00b2 = 0%), cardiac\u2010rhythm disorder (6 studies, 4483 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.75; I\u00b2 = 16%), and infection (5 studies, 4252 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.77; I\u00b2 = 0%); however, it is uncertain whether early KRT initiation increases or reduces the number of patients who experienced any adverse events (5 studies, 3983 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68; I\u00b2 = 91%; very low certainty evidence). Moderate certainty evidence showed early KRT initiation probably reduces the number of days in hospital (7 studies, 4589 participants: MD\u20102.45 days, 95% CI \u20104.75 to \u20100.14; I\u00b2 = 10%) and length of stay in ICU (5 studies, 4240 participants: MD \u20101.01 days, 95% CI \u20101.60 to \u20100.42; I\u00b2 = 0%). ", "conclusion": " Based on mainly low to moderate certainty of the evidence, early KRT has no beneficial effect on death and may increase the recovery of kidney function. Earlier KRT probably reduces the length of ICU and hospital stay but increases the risk of adverse events. Further adequate\u2010powered RCTs using robust and validated tools that complement clinical judgement are needed to define the optimal time of KRT in critical patients with AKI in order to improve their outcomes. The surgical AKI population should be considered in future research. "}

Data for meta\u2010analysis were available from all participants. Four RCTs (597 participants) compared higher\u2010dose heparin to standard\u2010dose heparin: one of these studies (139 participants) used unfractionated heparin (UFH) and the other three (458 participants) used low\u2010molecular\u2010weight heparin (LMWH). One study compared heparin versus pentasaccharide (198 participants), and one study compared starting heparin before versus after bariatric surgery (100 participants). One study (150 participants) compared combined mechanical and pharmacological (enoxaparin) prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone. The duration of the interventions ranged from seven to 15 days, and follow\u2010up ranged from 10 to 180 days.

Heparin may make little or no difference to venous thromboembolism in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to pentasaccharide. There are inadequate data to draw conclusions about the effects of heparin compared to pentasaccharide on major bleeding.

Combining mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis (started 12 hours before surgery) may reduce VTE events in people undergoing bariatric surgery when compared to mechanical prophylaxis alone. No data are available relating to major bleeding. The certainty of the evidence is limited by small sample sizes, few or no events, and risk of bias concerns.

Fourteen studies reported outcomes per woman randomised, and one study reported outcomes per ovary. No studies were at low risk of bias across all domains; the main limitation was lack of blinding. The certainty of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low, and was downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.

Two were RCTs (151 participants) and 16 were NRSs. Both RCTs had low risk of bias (RoB) in almost all domains. Of the 16 NRSs, 14 were retrospective cohort analyses with one prospective study and one case report. The nine studies used in quantitative analysis were judged to have critical RoB, three serious and three moderate.   1. PCC versus standard treatment Evidence from RCTs showed PCCs are likely to reduce the number of units transfused compared to standard care (MD \u20100.89, 95% CI \u20101.78 to 0.00; participants = 151; studies = 2; moderate\u2010quality evidence). Evidence from NRSs agreed with this, showing that PCCs may reduce the mean number of units transfused compared to standard care but the evidence is uncertain (MD \u20101.87 units, 95% CI \u20102.53 to \u20101.20; participants = 551; studies = 2; very low\u2010quality evidence).

There was no evidence from RCTs showing a difference in the number of thrombotic events with PCC compared to standard care (OR 0.68 95% CI 0.20 to 2.31; participants = 152; studies = 2; moderate\u2010quality evidence).

No studies reported on additional adverse outcomes.   2. PCC versus rFVIIa For this comparison, all evidence was provided from NRSs.  PCC likely results in a large reduction of RBCs transfused intra\u2010operatively in comparison to rFVIIa (MD\u20104.98 units, 95% CI \u20106.37 to \u20103.59; participants = 256; studies = 2; moderate\u2010quality evidence).

Participants were recruited from both clinical and community settings. Most were women in their 40s or 50s. Most trials used iyengar, hatha, or viniyoga yoga. Trials compared yoga to a non\u2010exercise control including waiting list, usual care, or education (10 trials); back\u2010focused exercise such as physical therapy (five trials); both exercise and non\u2010exercise controls (four trials); both non\u2010exercise and another mind\u2013body exercise (qigong) (one trial); and yoga plus exercise to exercise alone (one trial). One trial comparing yoga to exercise was an intensive residential one\u2010week program, and we analyzed this trial separately. All trials were at high risk of performance and detection bias because participants and providers were not blinded to treatment, and outcomes were self\u2010assessed. We found no trials comparing yoga to sham yoga. Low\u2010certainty evidence from 11 trials showed that there may be a small clinically unimportant improvement in back\u2010specific function with yoga (mean difference [MD] \u22121.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] \u22122.73 to \u22120.65 on the 0\u2010 to 24\u2010point Roland\u2010Morris Disability Questionnaire [RMDQ], lower = better, minimal clinically important difference [MCID] 5 points; 1155 participants) and moderate\u2010certainty evidence from nine trials showed a clinically unimportant improvement in pain (MD \u22124.53, 95% CI \u22126.61 to \u22122.46 on a 0 to 100 scale, 0 no pain, MCID 15 points; 946 participants) compared to no exercise at three months. Low\u2010certainty evidence from four trials showed that there may be a clinical improvement with yoga (risk ratio [RR] 2.33, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.71; assessed as participant rating that back pain was improved or resolved; 353 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence from six trials showed that there is probably a small improvement in physical and mental quality of life (physical: MD 1.80, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.33 on the 36\u2010item Short Form [SF\u201036] physical health scale, higher = better; mental: MD 2.38, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.17 on the SF\u201036 mental health scale, higher = better; both 686 participants).

There was low\u2010certainty evidence from eight trials that yoga increased the risk of adverse events, primarily increased back pain, at six to 12 months (RR 4.76, 95% CI 2.08 to 10.89; 43/1000 with yoga and 9/1000 with no exercise; 1037 participants). For yoga compared to back\u2010focused exercise controls (8 trials, 912 participants) at three months, we found moderate\u2010certainty evidence from four trials for little or no difference in back\u2010specific function (MD \u22120.38, 95% CI \u22121.33 to 0.62 on the RMDQ, lower = better; 575 participants) and very low\u2010certainty evidence from two trials for little or no difference in pain (MD 2.68, 95% CI \u22122.01 to 7.36 on a 0 to 100 scale, lower = better; 326 participants). We found very low\u2010certainty evidence from three trials for no difference in clinical improvement assessed as participant rating that back pain was improved or resolved (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.31; 433 participants) and very low\u2010certainty evidence from one trial for little or no difference in physical and mental quality of life (physical: MD 1.30, 95% CI \u22120.95 to 3.55 on the SF\u201036 physical health scale, higher = better; mental: MD 1.90, 95% CI \u22121.17 to 4.97 on the SF\u201036 mental health scale, higher = better; both 237 participants). No studies reported depression. Low\u2010certainty evidence from five trials showed that there was little or no difference between yoga and exercise in the risk of adverse events at six to 12 months (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.53; 84/1000 with yoga and 91/1000 with non\u2010yoga exercise; 640 participants).

There is probably little or no difference between yoga and other back\u2010related exercise for back\u2010related function at three months, although it remains uncertain whether there is any difference between yoga and other exercise for pain and quality of life. Yoga is associated with more adverse events than no exercise, but may have the same risk of adverse events as other exercise. In light of these results, decisions to use yoga instead of no exercise or another exercise may depend on availability, cost, and participant or provider preference. Since all studies were unblinded and at high risk of performance and detection bias, it is unlikely that blinded comparisons would find a clinically important benefit. "}

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD010315.pub5", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To determine if lower blood pressure targets (systolic/diastolic 135/85 mmHg or less) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard blood pressure targets (140 mmHg to 160mmHg/90 mmHg to 100 mmHg or less) in the treatment of people with hypertension and a history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular occlusive disease). \n\nMain results:\n We included seven RCTs that involved 9595 participants. Mean follow\u2010up was 3.7 years (range 1.0 to 4.7 years). Six of seven RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies was blinded to participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure goal. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all trials. Hence, we assessed all trials at high risk of performance bias and low risk of detection bias. We also considered other issues, such as early termination of studies and subgroups of participants not predefined, to downgrade the certainty of the evidence. We found there is probably little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.23; 7 studies, 9595 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; 6 studies, 9484 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

The evidence was very uncertain about withdrawals due to adverse effects. However, studies suggest more participants may withdraw due to adverse effects in the lower target group (RR 8.16, 95% CI 2.06 to 32.28; 3 studies, 801 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence).

There may also be little to no difference in serious adverse events or total cardiovascular events. This suggests that no net health benefit is derived from a lower systolic blood pressure target. We found very limited evidence on withdrawals due to adverse effects, which led to high uncertainty. At present, evidence is insufficient to justify lower blood pressure targets (135/85 mmHg or less) in people with hypertension and established cardiovascular disease.

The studies included 64,688 samples including 25,724 from people with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102; most compared the accuracy of two or more assays (102/178, 57%). Participants with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection were most commonly hospital inpatients (78/178, 44%), and pre\u2010pandemic samples were used by 45% (81/178) to estimate specificity. Over two\u2010thirds of studies recruited participants based on known SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection status (123/178, 69%). All studies were conducted prior to the introduction of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccines and present data for naturally acquired antibody responses. Seventy\u2010nine percent (141/178) of studies reported sensitivity by week after symptom onset and 66% (117/178) for convalescent phase infection. Studies evaluated enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (165/527; 31%), chemiluminescent assays (CLIA) (167/527; 32%) or lateral flow assays (LFA) (188/527; 36%). Risk of bias was high because of participant selection (172, 97%); application and interpretation of the index test (35, 20%); weaknesses in the reference standard (38, 21%); and issues related to participant flow and timing (148, 82%). We judged that there were high concerns about the applicability of the evidence related to participants in 170 (96%) studies, and about the applicability of the reference standard in 162 (91%) studies. Average sensitivities for current SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection increased by week after onset for all target antibodies. Average sensitivity for the combination of either IgG or IgM was 41.1% in week one (95% CI 38.1 to 44.2; 103 evaluations; 3881 samples, 1593 cases), 74.9% in week two (95% CI 72.4 to 77.3; 96 evaluations, 3948 samples, 2904 cases) and 88.0% by week three after onset of symptoms (95% CI 86.3 to 89.5; 103 evaluations, 2929 samples, 2571 cases). Average sensitivity during the convalescent phase of infection (up to a maximum of 100 days since onset of symptoms, where reported) was 89.8% for IgG (95% CI 88.5 to 90.9; 253 evaluations, 16,846 samples, 14,183 cases), 92.9% for IgG or IgM combined (95% CI 91.0 to 94.4; 108 evaluations, 3571 samples, 3206 cases) and 94.3% for total antibodies (95% CI 92.8 to 95.5; 58 evaluations, 7063 samples, 6652 cases). Average sensitivities for IgM alone followed a similar pattern but were of a lower test accuracy in every time slot. Average specificities were consistently high and precise, particularly for pre\u2010pandemic samples which provide the least biased estimates of specificity (ranging from 98.6% for IgM to 99.8% for total antibodies). Subgroup analyses suggested small differences in sensitivity and specificity by test technology however heterogeneity in study results, timing of sample collection, and smaller sample numbers in some groups made comparisons difficult. For IgG, CLIAs were the most sensitive (convalescent\u2010phase infection) and specific (pre\u2010pandemic samples) compared to both ELISAs and LFAs (P < 0.001 for differences across test methods). The antigen(s) used (whether from the Spike\u2010protein or nucleocapsid) appeared to have some effect on average sensitivity in the first weeks after onset but there was no clear evidence of an effect during convalescent\u2010phase infection. Investigations of test performance by brand showed considerable variation in sensitivity between tests, and in results between studies evaluating the same test. For tests that were evaluated in 200 or more samples, the lower bound of the 95% CI for sensitivity was 90% or more for only a small number of tests (IgG, n = 5; IgG or IgM, n = 1; total antibodies, n = 4). More test brands met the MHRA minimum criteria for specificity of 98% or above (IgG, n = 16; IgG or IgM, n = 5; total antibodies, n = 7). Seven assays met the specified criteria for both sensitivity and specificity. In a low\u2010prevalence (2%) setting, where antibody testing is used to diagnose COVID\u201019 in people with symptoms but who have had a negative PCR test, we would anticipate that 1 (1 to 2) case would be missed and 8 (5 to 15) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG or IgM testing in week three after onset of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. In a seroprevalence survey, where prevalence of prior infection is 50%, we would anticipate that 51 (46 to 58) cases would be missed and 6 (5 to 7) would be falsely positive in 1000 people having IgG tests during the convalescent phase (21 to 100 days post\u2010symptom onset or post\u2010positive PCR) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. ", "conclusion": " Some antibody tests could be a useful diagnostic tool for those in whom molecular\u2010 or antigen\u2010based tests have failed to detect the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus, including in those with ongoing symptoms of acute infection (from week three onwards) or those presenting with post\u2010acute sequelae of COVID\u201019. However, antibody tests have an increasing likelihood of detecting an immune response to infection as time since onset of infection progresses and have demonstrated adequate performance for detection of prior infection for sero\u2010epidemiological purposes. The applicability of results for detection of vaccination\u2010induced antibodies is uncertain. "}

We included seven trials with a total of 239 participants. Two trials had a cross\u2010over design, but outcome data were not available from the first phase (precross\u2010over) in an appropriate format for inclusion as a parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT). Thus, the results of the review are based on five trials with a total of 213 participants. It is uncertain whether fluoxetine increases the number of people who have a 50% reduction in emotionalism when compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.77; P = 0.02; 1 trial, 19 participants) because the certainty of evidence is very low. Sertraline may lead to little to no difference in Center for Neurologic Study \u2010 Lability Scale (CNS\u2010LS) scores and Clinician Interview\u2010Based Impression of Change (CIBIC) scores when compared to placebo (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.50; P = 0.12; 1 trial, 28 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Antidepressants probably increase the number of people who experience a reduction in tearfulness (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.86; P = 0.02; 3 trials, 164 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). No trials were found that evaluated the impact of other pharmaceutical interventions. Only two trial authors systematically recorded and reported adverse events, resulting in limited data on the potential harms of treatment. Six trials reported death as an adverse event and found no difference between the groups (antidepressants versus placebo) in the number of deaths reported (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08 to 4.50; P = 0.61; 172 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). This review provides very low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence that antidepressants may reduce the frequency and severity of emotionalism. The included trials were small and had some degree of bias. ", "conclusion": " Antidepressants may reduce the frequency and severity of crying or laughing episodes when compared to placebo, based on very low\u2010certainty evidence. Our conclusions must be qualified by several methodological deficiencies in the trials and interpreted with caution despite the effect being very large. The effect does not seem specific to one drug or class of drugs. More reliable data are required before appropriate conclusions can be made about the treatment of post\u2010stroke emotionalism. Future trialists investigating the effect of antidepressants in people with emotionalism after stroke should consider developing and using a standardised method to diagnose emotionalism, determine severity, and assess change over time; provide treatment for a sufficient duration and follow\u2010up to better assess rates of relapse or maintenance; and include careful assessment and complete reporting of adverse events.

Seventeen of the 78 included studies were new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated ten (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 50 at high risk overall (including all non\u2010randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There was high certainty that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.04; I 2  = 10%; 6 studies, 2378 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence (limited by imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.19; I 2  = 0%; 4 studies, 1702 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; I 2  = 34%; 5 studies, 2411 participants). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non\u2010nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 1447 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate\u2010certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I 2  = 0%; 5 studies, 1840 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I 2  = 0%; 8 studies, 1272 participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.65; I 2  = 0%; 7 studies, 3126 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 3). However, this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some evidence that (non\u2010serious) AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I 2  = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97; I 2  = 38%; 9 studies, 1993 participants).  Data from non\u2010randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit. ", "conclusion": " There is high\u2010certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate\u2010certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non\u2010nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow\u2010up was two years and the number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up\u2010to\u2010date information to decision\u2010makers, this review is a living systematic review.

A total of 4532 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 3766). These studies included participants mostly older than 50 years and male. We also identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID\u201019 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 11 RCTs (8019 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre\u2010specified outcomes and thus our analyses included outcome data from 10 studies. Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care compared to standard care probably reduce  all\u2010cause mortality (up to 30 days)  slightly (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 0.97; 7898 participants; estimated absolute effect: 274 deaths per 1000 people not receiving systemic corticosteroids compared to 246 deaths per 1000 people receiving the intervention (95% CI 230 to 265 per 1000 people); moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on  all\u2010cause mortality (up to 120 days)  (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.34; 485 participants). The chance of c linical improvement (discharged alive at day 28)  may slightly increase (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11; 6786 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) while the risk of  clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death)  may slightly decrease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 5586 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). For serious adverse events (two RCTs, 678 participants), adverse events (three RCTs, 447 participants), hospital\u2010acquired infections (four RCTs, 598 participants), and invasive fungal infections (one study, 64 participants), we did not perform any analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low\u2010certainty evidence (high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one RCT (86 participants) comparing methylprednisolone to dexamethasone, thus the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of methylprednisolone on all\u2010cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.07; 86 participants). None of the other outcomes of interest were reported in this study. We included four RCTs (1383 participants) comparing high\u2010dose dexamethasone (12 mg or higher) to low\u2010dose dexamethasone (6 mg to 8 mg). High\u2010dose dexamethasone compared to low\u2010dose dexamethasone may reduce all\u2010cause mortality (up to 30 days) (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.04; 1269 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of high\u2010dose dexamethasone on all\u2010cause mortality (up to 120 days) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08; 1383 participants) and it may have little or no impact on clinical improvement (discharged alive at 28 days) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.09; 200 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Studies did not report data on clinical worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death). For serious adverse events, adverse events, hospital\u2010acquired infections, and invasive fungal infections, we did not perform analyses beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. We could not identify studies for comparisons of different timing and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. Equity\u2010related subgroup analyses We conducted the following subgroup analyses to explore equity\u2010related factors: sex, age (< 70 years; \u2265 70 years), ethnicity (Black, Asian or other versus White versus unknown) and place of residence (high\u2010income versus low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries). Except for age and ethnicity, no evidence for differences could be identified. For all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days, participants younger than 70 years seemed to benefit from systemic corticosteroids in comparison to those aged 70 years and older. The few participants from a Black, Asian, or other minority ethnic group showed a larger estimated effect than the many White participants. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease There are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease. ", "conclusion": " Systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce  all\u2010cause mortality up to 30 days  in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID\u201019, while the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on  all\u2010cause mortality up to 120 days . For younger people (under 70 years of age) there was a potential advantage, as well as for Black, Asian, or people of a minority ethnic group; further subgroup analyses showed no relevant effects. Evidence related to the most effective type, dose, or timing of systemic corticosteroids remains immature. Currently, there is no evidence on asymptomatic or mild disease (non\u2010hospitalised participants). Due to the low to very low certainty of the current evidence, we cannot assess safety adequately to rule out harmful effects of the treatment, therefore there is an urgent need for good\u2010quality safety data. Findings of equity\u2010related subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution because of their explorative nature, low precision, and missing data. We identified 42 ongoing and 23 completed studies lacking published results or relevant information on the study design, suggesting there may be possible changes of the effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future.

Eleven studies compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba with placebo and one study compared the effects of Ginkgo biloba with hearing aids to hearing aids alone. All included studies were parallel\u2010group RCTs. In general, risk of bias was high or unclear due to selection bias and poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessments. Due to heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and measurement methods used, only limited data pooling was possible.  Ginkgo biloba versus placebo When we pooled data from two studies for the primary outcome tinnitus symptom severity, we found that Ginkgo biloba may have little to no effect (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores) at three to six months compared to placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) \u20101.35 (scale 0 to 100), 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20108.26 to 5.55; 2 studies; 85 participants) (very low\u2010certainty). Ginkgo biloba may result in little to no difference in the risk of bleeding or seizures, with no serious adverse effects reported in either group (4 studies; 1154 participants; low\u2010certainty). For the secondary outcomes, one study found that there may be little to no difference between the effects of Ginkgo biloba and placebo on tinnitus loudness measured with audiometric loudness matching at 12 weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD \u20104.00 (scale \u201010 to 140 dB), 95% CI \u201013.33 to 5.33; 1 study; 73 participants) (very low\u2010certainty).

It assessed the mean difference in the change in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores and tinnitus loudness using a 10\u2010point visual analogue scale (VAS) at three months. The study did not report adverse effects, tinnitus intrusiveness, changes in depressive symptoms or depression, anxiety symptoms or generalised anxiety, or health\u2010related quality of life. This was a single, very small study (22 participants) and for all outcomes the certainty of the evidence was very low. We were unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

The certainty of the evidence for the reported outcomes, assessed using GRADE, ranged from low to very low. Future research into the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba in patients with tinnitus should use rigorous methodology. Randomisation and blinding should be of the highest quality, given the subjective nature of tinnitus and the strong likelihood of a placebo response. The CONSORT statement should be used in the design and reporting of future studies. We also recommend the use of validated, patient\u2010centred outcome measures for research in the field of tinnitus. "}

Three studies included patients younger than 60 years of age; two trials accepted patients up to 80 years of age; and one trial only included patients 60 years or older. The majority of included trials (six) mandated a time from stroke ictus to treatment of < 48 hours, whilst in two of them this was < 96 hours.

Three studies were carried out in Japan, two in the USA, and one in France. The studies evaluated one comparison: professional oral care versus usual oral care. We did not include the results from one study (834 participants) because it had been stopped at interim analysis.  Consistent results from five studies, with 5018 participants, provided insufficient evidence of a difference between professional oral care and usual (simple, self\u2010administered) oral care in the incidence of pneumonia. Three studies reported HRs, one reported IRRs, and one reported RRs. Due to the variation in study design and follow\u2010up duration, we decided not to pool the data. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for this outcome by two levels to low: one level for study limitations (high risk of performance bias), and one level for imprecision. There was low\u2010certainty evidence from meta\u2010analysis of two individually randomised studies that professional oral care may reduce the risk of pneumonia\u2010associated mortality compared with usual oral care at 24 months' follow\u2010up (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76, 454 participants).

Low\u2010certainty evidence was inconclusive about the effects of this intervention on incidence and number of first episodes of NHAP. Due to differences in study design, effect measures, follow\u2010up duration, and composition of the interventions, we cannot determine the optimal oral care protocol from current evidence.  Future trials will require larger samples, robust methods that ensure low risk of bias, and more practicable interventions for nursing home residents. "}

Five studies included only children, and two limited their participant inclusion by disease severity. Overall, there were nearly twice as many males as females. All six studies compared add\u2010on statin therapy to cholesterol supplementation alone. However, the dosages, formulations, and durations of treatment were highly variable across studies. We judged the RCT as having a high risk of bias due to missing data and selective reporting. All included NRSIs had a serious or critical overall risk of bias assessed by the Risk Of Bias In Non\u2010randomized Studies of Interventions tool (ROBINS\u2010I). None of the included studies evaluated survival or reported quality of life (QoL). Only the included RCT formally assessed changes in the neurobehavioral manifestations of SLOS, and we are uncertain whether statin therapy improves this outcome (very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are also uncertain whether the adverse events reported in the RCT were statin\u2010related (very low\u2010certainty evidence). In contrast, the adverse events reported in the NRSIs seem to be possibly due to statin therapy (risk ratio 13.00, 95% confidence interval 1.85 to 91.49; P = 0.01; low\u2010certainty evidence), with only one of the NRSIs retrospectively mentioning changes in the irritability of two of their participants. We are uncertain whether statins affect growth based on the RCT or NRSI results (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The RCT showed that statins may make little or no difference to plasma biomarker levels (low\u2010certainty evidence), while we are uncertain of their effects on such parameters in the NRSIs (very low\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " Currently, there is no evidence on the potential effects of statin therapy in people with SLOS regarding survival or QoL, and very limited evidence on the effects on neurobehavioral manifestations. Likewise, current evidence is insufficient and of very low certainty regarding the effects of statins on growth parameters in children with SLOS and plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of various disease biomarkers. Despite these limitations, current evidence seemingly suggests that statins may increase the risk of adverse reactions in individuals with SLOS receiving statins compared to those who are not. Given the insufficient evidence on potential benefits of statins in individuals with SLOS, and their potential for causing adverse reactions, anyone considering this therapy should take these findings into consideration. Future studies should address the highlighted gaps in evidence on the use of statins in individuals with SLOS by collecting prospective data on survival and performing serial standardized assessments of neurobehavioral features, QoL, anthropometric measures, and plasma and CSF biomarker levels after statin introduction. Future studies should also attempt to use consistent dosages, formulations and durations of cholesterol and statin therapy. "}

Secondary objective To identify features of study populations such as age, hereditary risk, and adherence to interventions that are associated with the greatest treatment benefit or harm for both eczema and food allergy. \n\nMain results:\n We identified 33 RCTs comprising 25,827 participants. Of these, 17 studies randomising 5823 participants reported information on one or more outcomes specified in this review.  We included 11 studies, randomising 5217 participants, in one or more meta\u2010analyses (range 2 to 9 studies per individual meta\u2010analysis), with 10 of these studies providing IPD; the remaining 6 studies were included in the narrative results only.   Most studies were conducted at children's hospitals. Twenty\u2010five studies, including all those contributing data to meta\u2010analyses, randomised newborns up to age three weeks to receive a skin care intervention or standard infant skin care. Eight of the 11 studies contributing to meta\u2010analyses recruited infants at high risk of developing eczema or food allergy, although the definition of high risk varied between studies. Durations of intervention and follow\u2010up ranged from 24 hours to three years. All interventions were compared against no skin care intervention or local standard care. Of the 17 studies that reported information on our prespecified outcomes, 13 assessed emollients. We assessed most of the evidence in the review as low certainty and had some concerns about risk of bias. A rating of some concerns was most often due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors or significant missing data, which could have impacted outcome measurement but was judged unlikely to have done so. We assessed the evidence for the primary food allergy outcome as high risk of bias due to the inclusion of only one trial, where findings varied based on different assumptions about missing data. Skin care interventions during infancy probably do not change the risk of eczema by one to three years of age (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.31; risk difference 5 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI 28 less to 47 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 3075 participants, 7 trials) or time to onset of eczema (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.14; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 3349 participants, 9 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may increase the risk of IgE\u2010mediated food allergy by one to three years of age (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99 to 6.49; low\u2010certainty evidence; 976 participants, 1 trial) but may not change risk of allergic sensitisation to a food allergen by age one to three years (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71; low\u2010certainty evidence; 1794 participants, 3 trials). Skin care interventions during infancy may slightly increase risk of parent report of immediate reaction to a common food allergen at two years (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.61; low\u2010certainty evidence; 1171 participants, 1 trial); however, this was only seen for cow\u2019s milk, and may be unreliable due to over\u2010reporting of milk allergy in infants. Skin care interventions during infancy probably increase risk of skin infection over the intervention period (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.75; risk difference 17 more cases per 1000 infants, 95% CI one more to 38 more; moderate\u2010certainty evidence; 2728 participants, 6 trials) and may increase the risk of infant slippage over the intervention period (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.99; low\u2010certainty evidence; 2538 participants, 4 trials) and stinging/allergic reactions to moisturisers (RR 2.24, 95% 0.67 to 7.43; low\u2010certainty evidence; 343 participants, 4 trials), although CIs for slippages and stinging/allergic reactions were wide and include the possibility of no effect or reduced risk. Preplanned subgroup analyses showed that the effects of interventions were not influenced by age, duration of intervention, hereditary risk, filaggrin ( FLG ) mutation, chromosome 11 intergenic variant rs2212434,   or classification of intervention type for risk of developing eczema. We could not evaluate these effects on risk of food allergy. Evidence was insufficient to show whether adherence to interventions influenced the relationship between skin care interventions and eczema or food allergy development. ", "conclusion": " Based on low\u2010 to moderate\u2010certainty evidence, skin care interventions such as emollients during the first year of life in healthy infants are probably not effective for preventing eczema; may increase risk of food allergy; and probably increase risk of skin infection. Further study is needed to understand whether different approaches to infant skin care might prevent eczema or food allergy. "}
{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD013343.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To determine the efficacy of immunostimulants in preventing respiratory exacerbations in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, or both. \n\nMain results:\n This review included 36 studies involving 6192 participants. Studies were published between 1981 and 2015. Duration ranged from three to 14 months. The mean age of study participants varied between 35.2 and 82 years. Twelve studies examined participants with COPD only. Seventeen studies reported baseline lung function values; most indicated a moderate\u2010to\u2010severe degree of airflow limitation. Nineteen studies indicated inclusion of participants with a mean baseline exacerbation frequency of two or more in the preceding year. Immunostimulants investigated were OM\u201085, AM3,   RU41740 (Biostim), Ismigen, Diribiotine CK, thymomodulin, pidotimod, D53 (Ribomunyl), Lantigen B, Symbioflor, and hyaluronan; routes of administration were oral, sublingual, and subcutaneous. The risk of bias of the included studies was mostly low or unclear. Participants receiving immunostimulants for a mean duration of six months were slightly more likely to be free of exacerbations during that time (odds ratio (OR) 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.90; 15 RCTs, 2961 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The overall number needed to treat with immunostimulants for a mean of six months, to prevent one participant from experiencing an exacerbation, was 11 (95% CI 7 to 29). This outcome was associated with a moderate degree of unexplained heterogeneity (I 2  = 53%). Type of immunostimulant, baseline lung function, baseline exacerbation frequency, treatment duration, and follow\u2010up duration did not modify the effect size, although due to heterogeneity and limited study and participant numbers within some subgroups, the validity of the subgroup treatment effect estimates were uncertain. Immunostimulants probably result in little to no difference in all\u2010cause mortality (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.10; 5 RCTs, 1558 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) and respiratory\u2010related mortality (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.07; 2 RCTs, 735 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) compared to placebo; however, the effects were imprecise and data quality limited the certainty of these results.  There was a small improvement in health\u2010related quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), with immunostimulant compared to placebo (mean difference \u22124.59, 95% CI \u22127.59 to \u22121.59; 2 RCTs, 617 participants; very\u2010low certainty evidence). The effect estimate just met the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) score of 4 units; however, the CI width means the possibility of a non\u2010meaningful difference cannot be excluded. The pooled result from five studies indicated that immunostimulants likely reduce the number of participants requiring antibiotics over a mean duration of six months (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63; 542 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). This outcome had a low\u2010to\u2010moderate degree of heterogeneity (I 2  = 38%), but the direction of effect was consistent across all studies. There was no evidence of a difference in the odds of experiencing an adverse event with immunostimulant compared to placebo, over a mean duration of six months (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.21; 20 RCTs, 3780 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). The CI limits for the associated risk ratio (RR) did not cross thresholds for appreciable harm or benefit (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.13). An additional seven studies reported no events rates in either study arm. Meta\u2010analyses were not performed for the outcomes of exacerbation duration and respiratory\u2010related hospitalisation duration, due to high levels of heterogeneity across the included studies (exacerbation duration: I 2  = 92%; respiratory\u2010related hospitalisation duration: I 2  = 83%). Results from an effect direction plot and binomial probability test for exacerbation duration indicated that a significant proportion of studies (94% (95% CI 73% to 99%); P = 0.0002) favoured intervention, possibly indicating that immunostimulants are efficacious in reducing the mean exacerbation duration compared to placebo. However, the degree of uncertainty associated with this estimate remained high due to data quality and heterogeneity. Three studies reported mean duration of respiratory\u2010related hospitalisation, two of which demonstrated a direction of effect that favoured immunostimulant over placebo. ", "conclusion": " In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we are moderately confident that treatment with immunostimulants is associated with a small reduction in the likelihood of having an exacerbation and a moderate reduction in the requirement for antibiotics. Low numbers of events limit interpretation of the effect of immunostimulants on all\u2010cause and respiratory\u2010related mortality. We are uncertain whether immunostimulants improve quality of life, and whether they are associated with a reduction in exacerbation and respiratory\u2010related hospitalisation durations, although immunostimulants were generally associated with a positive effect direction in the studies that examined these outcomes. Immunostimulants appear to be safe and well\u2010tolerated, and are not associated with an increased risk of adverse events.  "}

Limited data were available for meta\u2010analyses due to the variability of trial design and reporting of results. A total of 11 trials (1130 participants) compared an inhaled antibiotic to placebo or usual treatment for a duration between three and 33 months. Five trials (1255 participants) compared different antibiotics, two trials (585 participants) compared different regimens of tobramycin and one trial (90 participants) compared intermittent tobramycin with continuous tobramycin alternating with aztreonam. One trial (18 participants) compared an antibiotic to placebo and also to a different antibiotic and so fell into both groups. The most commonly studied antibiotic was tobramycin which was studied in 12 trials. Inhaled antibiotics compared to placebo We found that inhaled antibiotics may improve lung function measured in a variety of ways (4 trials, 814 participants). Compared to placebo, inhaled antibiotics may also reduce the frequency of exacerbations (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 0.93; 3 trials, 946 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Inhaled antibiotics may lead to fewer days off school or work (quality of life measure) (mean difference (MD) \u20105.30 days, 95% CI \u20108.59 to \u20102.01; 1 trial, 245 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). There were insufficient data for us to be able to report an effect on nutritional outcomes and there was no effect on survival. There was no effect on antibiotic resistance seen in the two trials that were included in meta\u2010analyses. We are uncertain of the effect of the intervention on adverse events (very low\u2010certainty evidence), but tinnitus and voice alteration were the only events occurring more often in the inhaled antibiotics group. The overall certainty of evidence was deemed to be low for most outcomes due to risk of bias within the trials and imprecision due to low event rates. Different antibiotics or regimens compared Of the eight trials comparing different inhaled antibiotics or different antibiotic regimens, there was only one trial for each unique comparison. We found no differences between groups for any outcomes except for the following. Aztreonam lysine for inhalation probably improved forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV 1 ) % predicted compared to tobramycin (MD \u20103.40%, 95% CI \u20106.63 to \u20100.17; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, the method of defining the endpoint was different to the remaining trials and the participants were exposed to tobramycin for a long period making interpretation of the results problematic. We found no differences in any measure of lung function in the remaining comparisons. Trials measured pulmonary exacerbations in different ways and showed no differences between groups except for aztreonam lysine probably leading to fewer people needing treatment with additional antibiotics than with tobramycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.86; 1 trial, 273 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence); and there were fewer hospitalisations due to respiratory exacerbations with levofloxacin compared to tobramycin (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98; 1 trial, 282 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Important treatment\u2010related adverse events were not very common across comparisons, but were reported less often in the tobramycin group compared to both aztreonam lysine and colistimethate. We found the certainty of evidence for these comparisons to be directly related to the risk of bias within the individual trials and varied from low to high. ", "conclusion": " Long\u2010term treatment with inhaled anti\u2010pseudomonal antibiotics probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rates, but pooled estimates of the level of benefit were very limited. The best evidence available is for inhaled tobramycin. More evidence from trials measuring similar outcomes in the same way is needed to determine a better measure of benefit. Longer\u2010term trials are needed to look at the effect of inhaled antibiotics on quality of life, survival and nutritional outcomes. "}

This is 18 more trials than the 2010 review on this topic. Participants were predominantly female except for one trial that included men only. The mean age ranged from 16.2 to 39.7 years across the included trials. Twenty\u2010nine different types of medications compared to placebo or other medications were included in the analyses. Seventeen trials were funded or partially funded by the pharmaceutical industry, 10 were funded by universities or research foundations, eight received no funding, and 11 had unclear funding. For all reported effect sizes, negative effect estimates indicate beneficial effects by active medication. Compared with placebo, no difference in effects were observed on any of the primary outcomes at the end of treatment for any medication. Compared with placebo, medication may have little to no effect on BPD symptom severity, although the evidence is of very low certainty (antipsychotics: SMD \u20100.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u20100.45 to 0.08; 8 trials, 951 participants; antidepressants: SMD \u22120.27, 95% CI \u22120.65 to 1.18; 2 trials, 87 participants; mood stabilisers: SMD \u22120.07, 95% CI \u22120.43 to 0.57; 4 trials, 265 participants).

The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of medication compared with placebo on suicide\u2010related outcomes, with little to no effect (antipsychotics: SMD 0.05, 95 % CI \u22120.18 to 0.29; 7 trials, 854 participants; antidepressants: SMD \u22120.26, 95% CI \u22121.62 to 1.09; 2 trials, 45 participants; mood stabilisers: SMD \u22120.36, 95% CI \u22121.96 to 1.25; 2 trials, 44 participants). Very low\u2010certainty evidence shows little to no difference between medication and placebo on psychosocial functioning (antipsychotics: SMD \u22120.16, 95% CI \u22120.33 to 0.00; 7 trials, 904 participants; antidepressants: SMD \u22120.25, 95% CI \u20100.57 to 0.06; 4 trials, 161 participants; mood stabilisers: SMD \u22120.01, 95% CI \u20100.28 to 0.26; 2 trials, 214 participants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests that antipsychotics may slightly reduce interpersonal problems (SMD \u22120.21, 95% CI \u22120.34 to \u20100.08; 8 trials, 907 participants), and that mood stabilisers may result in a reduction in this outcome (SMD \u22120.58, 95% CI \u20101.14 to \u20100.02; 4 trials, 300 participants). Antidepressants may have little to no effect on interpersonal problems, but the corresponding evidence is very uncertain (SMD \u22120.07, 95% CI \u20100.69 to 0.55; 2 trials, 119 participants). The evidence is very uncertain about dropout rates compared with placebo by antipsychotics (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.38; 13 trials, 1216 participants). Low\u2010certainty evidence suggests there may be no difference in dropout rates between antidepressants (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.76; 6 trials, 289 participants) and mood stabilisers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.15; 9 trials, 530 participants), compared to placebo. Reporting on adverse events was poor and mostly non\u2010standardised. The available evidence on non\u2010serious adverse events was of very low certainty for antipsychotics (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.29; 5 trials, 814 participants) and mood stabilisers (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.01; 1 trial, 276 participants).

Very limited data were available for serious adverse events. The review supports the continued understanding that no pharmacological therapy seems effective in specifically treating BPD pathology. More research is needed to understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of BPD better. Also, more trials including comorbidities such as trauma\u2010related disorders, major depression, substance use disorders, or eating disorders are needed. Additionally, more focus should be put on male and adolescent samples. "}

All trials were small (median number of participants 118). The trials occurred after 2001 in care facilities internationally, predominantly in India (eight trials). Most participants were preterm infants of 26 to 34 weeks' gestation who received nasal CPAP as the primary form of respiratory support after birth. The studied interfaces included commonly used commercially available masks and prongs. Lack of measures to blind caregivers or investigators was a potential source of performance and detection bias in all the trials.

Most participants were adults with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder, in higher\u2010income countries. None of the studies included children or adolescents.  Primary outcomes We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve clinical outcomes, such as psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety, and readmission, compared with control due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. For readmission, we conducted subgroup analysis between studies that used usual care and those that used cognitive training in the control group. There were no subgroup differences. Regarding participation (by the person with the mental health condition) or level of involvement in the decision\u2010making process, we are uncertain if SDM interventions improve observations on the process of SDM compared with no intervention due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. On the other hand, SDM interventions may improve SDM\u2010specific user\u2010reported outcomes from encounters immediately after intervention compared with no intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.01; 3 studies, 534 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). However, there was insufficient evidence for sustained participation or involvement in the decision\u2010making processes. Secondary outcomes We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve recovery compared with no intervention due to very low\u2010certainty evidence. We are uncertain if SDM interventions improve users' overall satisfaction. However, one study (241 participants) showed that SDM interventions probably improve some aspects of users' satisfaction with received information compared with no intervention: information given was rated as helpful (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.65); participants expressed a strong desire to receive information this way for other treatment decisions (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.68); and strongly recommended the information be shared with others in this way (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.58). The evidence was of moderate certainty for these outcomes. However, this same study reported there may be little or no effect on amount or clarity of information, while another small study reported there may be little or no change in carer satisfaction with the SDM intervention. The effects of healthcare professional satisfaction were mixed: SDM interventions may have little or no effect on healthcare professional satisfaction when measured continuously, but probably improve healthcare professional satisfaction when assessed categorically. We are uncertain whether SDM interventions improve knowledge, treatment continuation assessed through clinic visits, medication continuation, carer participation, and the relationship between users and healthcare professionals because of very low\u2010certainty evidence. Regarding length of consultation, SDM interventions probably have little or no effect compared with no intervention (SDM 0.09, 95% CI \u20100.24 to 0.41; 2 studies, 282 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

To describe and summarize the interventions on mosquito aquatic habitat modification or mosquito aquatic habitat manipulation, or both, on malaria control. 2. To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of mosquito aquatic habitat modification or mosquito aquatic habitat manipulation, or both, on malaria control. \n\nMain results:\n Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Six used an RCT design, six used a controlled before\u2010after (CBA) study design, three used a non\u2010randomized controlled design, and one used an uncontrolled BA study design. Eleven studies were conducted in Africa and five in Asia. Five studies reported epidemiological outcomes and 15 studies reported entomological outcomes. None of the included studies reported on the environmental impacts associated with the intervention. For risk of bias, all trials had some concerns and other designs ranging from moderate to critical. Ten studies assessed habitat manipulation (temporary change to the environment). This included water management (spillways across streams; floodgates; intermittent flooding; different drawdown rates of water; different flooding and draining regimens), shading management (shading of drainage channels with different plants), other/combined management approaches (minimal tillage; disturbance of aquatic habitats with grass clearing and water replenishment), which showed mixed results for entomological outcomes. Spillways across streams, faster drawdown rates of water, shading drainage canals with Napier grass, and using minimal tillage may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes (range of effects from 95% reduction to 1.7 times increase; low\u2010certainty evidence), and spillways across streams may reduce densities of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (low\u2010certainty evidence). However, the effect of habitat manipulation on malaria parasite prevalence and clinical malaria incidence is uncertain (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies assessed habitat manipulation with larviciding. This included reducing or removal of habitat sites; and drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs. It is uncertain whether drain cleaning, grass cutting, and minor repairs reduces malaria parasite prevalence compared to no intervention (odds ratio 0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.83; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Two studies assessed combination of habitat manipulation and permanent change (habitat modification). This included drainage canals, filling, and planting of papyrus and other reeds for shading near dams; and drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches. Studies did not report on epidemiological outcomes, but entomological outcomes suggest that such activities may reduce the density of adult mosquitoes compared to no intervention (relative risk reduction 0.49, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.50; low\u2010certainty evidence), and preventing water stagnating using drainage of canals, removal of debris, land levelling, and filling ditches may reduce the density of immature mosquitoes compared to no intervention (ranged from 10% to 55% reductions; low\u2010certainty evidence). Three studies assessed combining manipulation and modification with larviciding. This included filling or drainage of water bodies; filling, draining, or elimination of rain pools and puddles at water supply points and stream bed pools; and shoreline work, improvement and maintenance to drainage, clearing vegetation and undergrowth, and filling pools. There were mixed effect sizes for the reduction of entomological outcomes (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). However, filling or draining water bodies probably makes little or no difference to malaria parasite prevalence, haemoglobin levels, or entomological inoculation rate when delivered with larviciding compared to no intervention (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). ", "conclusion": " Habitat modification and manipulation interventions for preventing malaria has some indication of benefit in both epidemiological and entomological outcomes. While the data are quite mixed and further studies could help improve the knowledge base, these varied approaches may be useful in some circumstances. "}

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD005955.pub3", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To evaluate the benefits and harms of exercise interventions for acutely hospitalised older medical inpatients on functional ability, quality of life (QoL), participant global assessment of success and adverse events compared to usual care or a sham\u2010control intervention. \n\nMain results:\n We included 24 studies (nine rehabilitation\u2010related activity interventions, six structured exercise interventions and nine progressive resistance exercise interventions) with 7511 participants. All studies compared exercise interventions to usual care; two studies, in addition to usual care, used sham interventions. Mean ages ranged from 73 to 88 years, and 58% of participants were women. Several studies were at high risk of bias. The most common domain assessed at high risk of bias was measurement of the outcome, and five studies (21%) were at high risk of bias arising from the randomisation process. Exercise may have no clinically important effect on independence in activities of daily living at discharge from hospital compared to controls (16 studies, 5174 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Five studies used the Barthel Index (scale: 0 to 100, higher scores representing greater independence). Mean scores at discharge in the control groups ranged from 42 to 96 points, and independence in activities of daily living was 1.8 points better (0.43 worse to 4.12 better) with exercise compared to controls. The minimally clinical important difference (MCID) is estimated to be 11 points. We are uncertain regarding the effect of exercise on functional mobility at discharge from the hospital compared to controls (8 studies, 2369 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Three studies used the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (scale: 0 to 12, higher scores representing better function) to measure functional mobility. Mean scores at discharge in the control groups ranged from 3.7 to 4.9 points on the SPPB, and the estimated effect of the exercise interventions was 0.78 points better (0.02 worse to 1.57 better). A change of 1 point on the SPPB represents an MCID. We are uncertain regarding the effect of exercise on the incidence of delirium during hospitalisation compared to controls (7 trials, 2088 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The incidence of delirium during hospitalisation was 88/1091 (81 per 1000) in the control group compared with 70/997 (73 per 1000; range 47 to 114) in the exercise group (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.41). Exercise interventions may result in a small clinically unimportant improvement in QoL at discharge from the hospital compared to controls (4 studies, 875 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Mean QoL on the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ\u20105D) visual analogue scale (VAS) (scale: 0 to 100, higher scores representing better QoL) ranged between 48.9 and 64.7 in the control group at discharge from the hospital, and QoL was 6.04 points better (0.9 better to 11.18 better) with exercise. A change of 10 points on the EQ\u20105D VAS represents an MCID. No studies measured participant global assessment of success. Exercise interventions did not affect the risk of falls during hospitalisation (moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The incidence of falls was 31/899 (34 per 1000) in the control group compared with 31/888 (34 per 1000; range 20 to 57) in the exercise group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.65). We are uncertain regarding the effect of exercise on the incidence of medical deterioration during hospitalisation (very low\u2010certainty evidence). The incidence of medical deterioration in the control group was 101/1417 (71 per 1000) compared with 96/1313 (73 per 1000; range 44 to 120) in the exercise group (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.68). Subgroup analyses by different intervention categories and by the use of a sham intervention were not meaningfully different from the main analyses. ", "conclusion": " Exercise may make little difference to independence in activities of daily living or QoL, but probably does not result in more falls in older medical inpatients. We are uncertain about the effect of exercise on functional mobility, incidence of delirium and medical deterioration. Certainty of evidence was limited by risk of bias and inconsistency. Future primary research on the effect of exercise on acute hospitalisation could focus on more consistent and uniform reporting of participant's characteristics including their baseline level of functional ability, as well as exercise dose, intensity and adherence that may provide an insight into the reasons for the observed inconsistencies in findings.

The risk of bias was low in six studies. Five studies were open label, and we rated them at high risk of performance bias. We also rated one of these studies at high risk for attrition and reporting bias.  Five trials reported on poor outcome (death, vegetative state, or (moderate) severe disability), with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 1.13; P = 0.53; 5 trials, 2359 participants; high\u2010quality evidence), which showed no difference between groups.

In trials that combined short\u2010term antifibrinolytic treatment (< 72 hours) with preventative measures for delayed cerebral ischaemia, the RR for poor outcome was 0.98 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.18; P = 0.83; 2 trials, 1318 participants; high\u2010quality evidence).

The studies included people with Type I and II HAE. The studies investigated avoralstat, berotralstat, subcutaneous C1\u2010INH, plasma\u2010derived C1\u2010INH, nanofiltered C1\u2010INH, recombinant human C1\u2010INH, danazol, and lanadelumab for the prevention of HAE attacks. We did not find any studies on the use of tranexamic acid for prevention of HAE attacks. All drugs except avoralstat reduced the number of HAE attacks compared with placebo. For breakthrough attacks that occurred despite prophylactic treatment, intravenous and subcutaneous forms of C1\u2010INH and lanadelumab reduced attack severity. It is not known whether other drugs have a similar effect, as the severity of breakthrough attacks in people taking drugs other than C1\u2010INH and lanadelumab was not reported. For quality of life, avoralstat, berotralstat, C1\u2010INH (all forms) and lanadelumab increased quality of life compared with placebo; there were no data for danazol. Four studies reported on changes in disability during treatment with C1\u2010INH, berotralstat and lanadelumab; all three drugs decreased disability compared with placebo. Adverse events, including serious adverse events, did not occur at a rate higher than placebo. However, serious adverse event data and other adverse event data were not available for danazol, which prevented us from drawing conclusions about the absolute or relative safety of this drug. No deaths were reported in the included studies. The analysis was limited by the small number of studies, the small number of participants in each study and the lack of data on older drugs, therefore the certainty of the evidence is low. Given the rarity of HAE, it is not surprising that drugs were rarely directly compared, which does not allow conclusions on the comparative efficacy of the various drugs for people with HAE. Finally, we did not identify any studies that included people with Type III HAE. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of any drug in people with this form of HAE. ", "conclusion": " The available data suggest that berotralstat, C1\u2010INH (subcutaneous, plasma\u2010derived, nanofiltered and recombinant), danazol and lanadelumab are effective in lowering the risk or incidence (or both) of HAE attacks. In addition, C1\u2010INH and lanadelumab decrease the severity of breakthrough attacks (data for other drugs were not available). Avoralstat, berotralstat, C1\u2010INH (all forms) and lanadelumab increase quality of life and do not increase the risk of adverse events, including serious adverse events. It is possible that danazol, subcutaneous C1\u2010INH and recombinant human C1\u2010INH are more effective than berotralstat and lanadelumab in reducing the risk of breakthrough attacks, but the small number of studies and the small size of the studies means that the certainty of the evidence is low.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD014831.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To compare the effectiveness and safety of selected DMARDs (methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and azathioprine) in the treatment of NIIPPU in adults. \n\nMain results:\n We included 11 RCTs with a total of 601 participants in this review. DMARDs versus control Two studies compared an experimental DMARD (cyclosporine A or enteric\u2010coated mycophenolate [EC\u2010MPS]) plus oral steroid with steroid monotherapy. We did not pool these results into a meta\u2010analysis because the dose of cyclosporine used was much higher than that used in current clinical practice. The evidence is very uncertain about whether EC\u2010MPS plus low\u2010dose oral steroid results in a higher proportion of participants achieving control of inflammation over steroid monotherapy (risk ratio [RR] 2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10 to 7.17; 1 study, 41 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The change in best\u2010corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was reported separately for right and left eyes. The evidence for improvement (lower logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) indicates better vision) between the groups is very uncertain (mean difference [MD] \u20100.03 and \u20100.10, 95% CI \u20100.96 to 0.90 and \u20100.27 to 0.07 for right and left, respectively; 1 study, 82 eyes; very low\u2010certainty evidence). No data were available for the following outcomes: proportion of participants achieving a 2\u2010line improvement in visual acuity, with confirmed macular edema, or achieving steroid\u2010sparing control. The evidence for the proportion of participants requiring cessation of medication in the DMARD versus control group is very uncertain (RR 2.61, 95% CI 0.11 to 60.51; 1 study, 41 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Methotrexate versus mycophenolate We were able to combine two studies into a meta\u2010analysis comparing methotrexate versus mycophenolate mofetil. Methotrexate probably results in a slight increase in the proportion of participants achieving control of inflammation, including steroid\u2010sparing control, compared to mycophenolate at six months (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.50; 2 studies, 261 participants; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). Change in BCVA was reported per eye and the treatments likely result in little to no difference in change in vision (MD 0.01 logMAR higher [worse] for methotrexate versus mycophenolate; 2 studies, 490 eyes; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). No data were available for the proportion of participants achieving a 2\u2010line improvement in visual acuity. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the proportion of participants with confirmed macular edema between methotrexate versus mycophenolate (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.30; 2 studies, 35 eyes; very low\u2010certainty). Methotrexate versus mycophenolate may result in little to no difference in the proportion of participants requiring cessation of medication (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.27; 2 studies, 296 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Steroids with or without azathioprine versus cyclosporine A Four studies compared steroids with or without azathioprine (oral steroids, intravenous [IV] steroids, or azathioprine) to cyclosporine A. We excluded two studies from the meta\u2010analysis because the participants were treated with 8 mg to 15 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine A, a significantly higher dose than is utilized today because of concerns for nephrotoxicity. The remaining two studies were conducted in all Vogt\u2010Koyanagi\u2010Harada disease (VKH) populations and compared cyclosporine A to azathioprine or IV pulse\u2010dose steroids. The evidence is very uncertain for whether the steroids with or without azathioprine or cyclosporine A influenced the proportion of participants achieving control of inflammation (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; 2 studies, 112 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), achieving steroid\u2010sparing control (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.25; 1 study, 21 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), or requiring cessation of medication (RR 0.85, 95% 0.21 to 3.45; 2 studies, 91 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain for improvement in BCVA (MD 0.04 logMAR lower [better] with the steroids with or without azathioprine versus cyclosporine A; 2 studies, 91 eyes; very low\u2010certainty evidence). There were no data available (with current cyclosporine A dosing) for the proportion of participants achieving a 2\u2010line improvement in visual acuity or with confirmed macular edema. Studies not included in synthesis We were unable to include three studies in any of the comparisons (in addition to the aforementioned studies excluded based on historic doses of cyclosporine A). One was a dose\u2010response study comparing cyclosporine A to cyclosporine G, a formulation which was never licensed and is not clinically available. We excluded another study from meta\u2010analysis because it compared cyclosporine A and tacrolimus, considered to be of the same class (calcineurin inhibitors). We were unable to combine the third study, which examined tacrolimus monotherapy versus tacrolimus plus oral steroid, with any group. ", "conclusion": " There is a paucity of data regarding which DMARD is most effective or safe in NIIPPU. Studies in general were small, heterogenous in terms of their design and outcome measures, and often did not compare different classes of DMARD with each other. Methotrexate is probably slightly more efficacious than mycophenolate in achieving control of inflammation, including steroid\u2010sparing control (moderate\u2010certainty evidence), although there was insufficient evidence to prefer one medication over the other in the VKH subgroup (very low\u2010certainty evidence). Methotrexate may result in little to no difference in safety outcomes compared to mycophenolate. "}

We identified 12 ongoing studies. We applied GRADE judgements to our results; the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome ranged from moderate to very low, with the main limitations being risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

IUDs Immediate insertion of IUDs probably improves the initiation rate compared with delayed insertion, regardless of type of IUD (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.51; 10 studies, 1894 participants; I 2  = 98%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).

Similar findings were reported for the secondary breastfeeding outcomes except for any breastfeeding at two months and 12 months when the evidence was uncertain if 'breastfeeding only' support helped reduce the number of women stopping breastfeeding.  The evidence for 'breastfeeding plus' was less consistent. For primary outcomes there was some evidence that 'breastfeeding plus' support probably reduced the number of women stopping any breastfeeding (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.97, moderate\u2010certainty evidence) or exclusive breastfeeding at six months (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90).  'Breastfeeding plus' interventions may have a beneficial effect on reducing the number of women stopping exclusive breastfeeding at 4\u20106 weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.95). The evidence suggests that 'breastfeeding plus' support probably results in little to no difference in the number of women stopping any breastfeeding at 4\u20106 weeks (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08, moderate\u2010certainty evidence). For the secondary outcomes, it was uncertain if 'breastfeeding plus' support helped reduce the number of women stopping any or exclusive breastfeeding at any time points.  There were no consistent findings emerging from the narrative synthesis of the non\u2010breastfeeding outcomes (maternal satisfaction with care, maternal satisfaction with feeding method, infant morbidity, and maternal mental health), except for a possible reduction of diarrhoea in intervention infants.  We considered the overall risk of bias of trials included in the review was mixed. Blinding of participants and personnel is not feasible in such interventions and as studies utilised self\u2010report breastfeeding data, there is also a risk of bias in outcome assessment.   We conducted meta\u2010regression to explore substantial heterogeneity for the primary outcomes using the following categories: person providing care; mode of delivery; intensity of support; and income status of country.  It is possible that moderate levels (defined as 4\u20108 visits) of 'breastfeeding only' support may be associated with a more beneficial effect on exclusive breastfeeding at 4\u20106 weeks and six months. 'Breastfeeding only' support may also be more effective in reducing women in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMICs) stopping exclusive breastfeeding at six months compared to women in high\u2010income countries (HICs). However, no other differential effects were found and thus heterogeneity remains largely unexplained. The meta\u2010regression suggested that there were no differential effects regarding person providing support or mode of delivery, however, power was limited.  ", "conclusion": " When 'breastfeeding only' support is offered to women, the duration and in particular, the exclusivity of breastfeeding is likely to be increased. Support may also be more effective in reducing the number of women stopping breastfeeding at three to four months compared to later time points.  For 'breastfeeding plus' interventions the evidence is less certain. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Support can also be offered face\u2010to\u2010face, via telephone or digital technologies, or a combination and may be more effective when delivered on a schedule of four to eight visits. Further work is needed to identify components of the effective interventions and to deliver interventions on a larger scale. "}

All studies had important methodological limitations. We assessed most studies (11 studies) as at high risk of bias for at least one domain, and all studies as at unclear risk of bias for at least two domains. The trials included participants aged > 18 years old, of which 70% to 100% were men, who were followed from one week to 60 months. The included studies assessed the effects of different modes of NIPV and CSA. Most participants had CSA associated with chronic heart failure. Because CSA encompasses a variety of causes and underlying clinical conditions, data were carefully analysed, and different conditions and populations were not pooled. The findings for the primary outcomes for the seven evaluated comparisons are presented below.  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) plus best supportive care versus best supportive care in CSA associated with chronic heart failure In the short term, CPAP plus best supportive care may reduce central apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) (mean difference (MD) \u221214.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u221220.11 to \u22129.09; 1 study; 205 participants). However, CPAP plus best supportive care may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality compared to best supportive care alone. The evidence for the effect of CPAP plus best supportive care on all\u2010cause mortality is very uncertain. No adverse effects were observed with CPAP, and the results for adverse events in the best supportive care group were not reported. Adaptive servo ventilation (ASV) versus CPAP in CSA associated with chronic heart failure The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ASV versus CPAP on quality of life evaluated in both the short and medium term. Data on adverse events were not reported, and it is not clear whether data were sought but not found. ASV versus bilevel ventilation in CSA associated with chronic heart failure In the short term, ASV may result in little to no difference in central AHI. No adverse events were detected with ASV, and the results for adverse events in the bilevel ventilation group were not reported. ASV plus best supportive care versus best supportive care in CSA associated with chronic heart failure In the medium term, ASV plus best supportive care may reduce AHI compared to best supportive care alone (MD \u221220.30, 95% CI \u221228.75 to \u221211.85; 1 study; 30 participants). In the long term, ASV plus best supportive care likely increases cardiovascular mortality compared to best supportive care (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.04, 1.49; 1 study; 1325 participants). The evidence suggests that ASV plus best supportive care may result in little to no difference in quality of life in the short, medium, and long term, and in all\u2010cause mortality in the medium and long term. Data on adverse events were evaluated but not reported. ASV plus best supportive care versus best supportive care in CSA with acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction Only adverse events were reported for this comparison, and no adverse events were recorded in either group. ASV versus CPAP maintenance in CPAP\u2010induced CSA In the short term, ASV may slightly reduce central AHI (MD \u22124.10, 95% CI \u22126.67 to \u22121.53; 1 study; 60 participants), but may result in little to no difference in quality of life. Data on adverse events were not reported, and it is not clear whether data were sought but not found. ASV versus bilevel ventilation in CPAP\u2010induced CSA In the short term, ASV may slightly reduce central AHI (MD \u22128.70, 95% CI \u221211.42 to \u22125.98; 1 study; 30 participants) compared to bilevel ventilation. Data on adverse events were not reported, and it is not clear whether data were sought but not found. ", "conclusion": " CPAP plus best supportive care may reduce central AHI in people with CSA associated with chronic heart failure compared to best supportive care alone. Although ASV plus best supportive care may reduce AHI in people with CSA associated with chronic heart failure, it likely increases cardiovascular mortality in these individuals. In people with CPAP\u2010induced CSA, ASV may slightly reduce central AHI compared to bilevel ventilation and to CPAP. In the absence of data showing a favourable impact on meaningful patient\u2010centred outcomes and defining clinically important differences in outcomes in CSA patients, these findings need to be interpreted with caution. Considering the level of certainty of the available evidence and the heterogeneity of participants with CSA, we could draw no definitive conclusions, and further high\u2010quality trials focusing on patient\u2010centred outcomes, such as quality of life, quality of sleep, and longer\u2010term survival, are needed to determine whether one mode of NIPV is better than another or than best supportive care for any particular CSA patient group.

Most of these studies included women with unexplained infertility. Intentional endometrial injury versus either no intervention or a sham procedure The primary analysis was restricted to studies at low risk of bias, which left only one study included. We are uncertain whether endometrial injury has an effect on the probability of live birth, as only one study is included in the analysis and the confidence interval is wide (risk ratio (RR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.59; 1 RCT, 210 participants). Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth with no intervention/a sham procedure is assumed to be 34%, then the chance with endometrial injury would be 27% to 55%. When all studies were included in the sensitivity analysis, we were uncertain whether endometrial injury improves live birth/ongoing pregnancy, as the evidence was of very low quality (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.21; 8 RCTs, 1522 participants; I\u00b2 = 16%). Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth/ongoing pregnancy with no intervention/a sham procedure is assumed to be 13%, then the chance with endometrial injury would be 17% to 28%. A narrative synthesis conducted for the other primary outcome of pain during the procedure included studies measuring pain on a zero\u2010to\u2010ten visual analogue scale (VAS) or grading pain as mild/moderate/severe, and showed that most often mild to moderate pain was reported (6 RCTs, 911 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). Timing of intentional endometrial injury Four trials compared endometrial injury performed in the cycle before IUI to that performed in the same cycle as IUI. None of these studies reported the primary outcomes of live birth/ongoing pregnancy and pain during the procedure. One study compared endometrial injury in the early follicular phase (EFP; Day 2 to 4) to endometrial injury in the late follicular phase (LFP; Day 7 to 9), both in the same cycle as IUI. The primary outcome live birth/ongoing pregnancy was not reported, but the study did report the other primary outcome of pain during the procedure assessed by a zero\u2010to\u2010ten VAS. The average pain score was 3.67 (standard deviation (SD) 0.7) when endometrial injury was performed in the EFP and 3.84 (SD 0.96) when endometrial injury was performed in the LFP. The mean difference was \u20100.17, suggesting that on average, women undergoing endometrial injury in the EFP scored 0.17 points lower on the VAS as compared to women undergoing endometrial injury in the LFP (95% CI \u20100.48 to 0.14; 1 RCT, 110 participants; very low\u2010quality evidence). ", "conclusion": " Evidence is insufficient to show whether there is a difference in live birth/ongoing pregnancy between endometrial injury and no intervention/a sham procedure in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse. The pooled results should be interpreted with caution, as the evidence was of low to very low quality due to high risk of bias present in most included studies and an overall low level of precision. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of timing of endometrial injury did not report the outcome live birth/ongoing pregnancy; therefore no conclusions could be drawn for this outcome. Further well\u2010conducted RCTs that recruit large numbers of participants and minimise bias are required to confirm or refute these findings. Current evidence is insufficient to support routine use of endometrial injury in women undergoing IUI or attempting to conceive via sexual intercourse. "}

These RCTs reported outcome data from a total of 4169 participants with DED.  Study characteristics and risk of bias All trials recruited adults aged 18 years or older, except one trial that enrolled children and adolescents aged between 3 and 14 years. Half of these trials involved predominantly female participants (median 79%, interquartile range [IQR] 76% to 80%). On average, each trial enrolled 86 participants (IQR 40 to 158). The treatment duration of topical steroids ranged between one week and three months; trial duration lasted between one week and six months. Eight trials were sponsored exclusively by industry, and four trials were co\u2010sponsored by industry and institutional or governmental funds. We assessed the risk of bias of both subjective and objective outcomes using RoB 2, finding nearly half of the trials to be at high risk of bias associated with selective outcome reporting. Findings Of the 22 trials, 16 evaluated effects of topical steroids, alone or in combination with tobramycin, as compared with lubricants (AT, vehicle), AT plus tobramycin, or no treatment. Corticosteroids probably have a small to moderate effect on improving patient\u2010reported symptoms by 0.29 standardized mean difference (SMD) (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.42) as compared with lubricants (moderate certainty evidence). Topical steroids also likely have a small to moderate effect on lowering corneal staining scores by 0.4 SMDs (95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) (moderate certainty evidence). However, steroids may increase tear film break\u2010up time (TBUT) slightly (mean difference [MD] 0.70 s, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.34; low certainty evidence) but not tear osmolarity (MD 1.60 mOsm/kg, 95% CI \u221210.47 to 13.67; very low certainty evidence).  Six trials examined topical steroids, either alone or in combination with CsA, against CsA alone. Low certainty evidence indicates that steroid\u2010based interventions may have a small to moderate effect on improving participants' symptoms (SMD \u22120.33, 95% CI \u22120.51 to \u22120.15), but little to no effect on corneal staining scores (SMD 0.05, 95% CI \u22120.25 to 0.35) as compared with CsA. The effect of topical steroids compared to CsA alone on TBUT (MD 0.37 s, 95% CI \u22120.13 to 0.87) or tear osmolarity (MD 5.80 mOsm/kg, 95% CI \u22120.94 to 12.54; loteprednol etabonate alone) is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is low or very low. None of the included trials reported on quality of life scores. Adverse effects The evidence for adverse ocular effects of topical corticosteroids is very uncertain. Topical corticosteroids may increase participants' risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation (risk ratio [RR] 5.96, 95% CI 1.30 to 27.38) as compared with lubricants. However, when compared with CsA, steroids alone or combined with CsA may decrease or increase IOP elevation (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.33). It is also uncertain whether topical steroids may increase risk of cataract formation when compared with lubricants (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.22), given the short\u2010term use and study duration (four weeks or less) to observe longer\u2010term adverse effects.  ", "conclusion": " Overall, the evidence for the specified review outcomes was of moderate to very low certainty, mostly due to high risk of bias associated with selective results reporting. For dry eye patients whose symptoms require anti\u2010inflammatory control, topical corticosteroids probably provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond lubricants, and may provide small to moderate degrees of symptom relief beyond CsA. However, the current evidence is less certain about the effects of steroids on improved tear film quality or quantity. The available evidence is also very uncertain regarding the adverse effects of topical corticosteroids on IOP elevation or cataract formation or progression. Future trials should generate high certainty evidence to inform physicians and patients of the optimal treatment strategies with topical corticosteroids in terms of regimen (types, formulations, dosages), duration, and its time\u2010dependent adverse profile.

Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain For radicular low back pain, moderate\u2010certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short\u2010term follow\u2010up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long\u2010term follow\u2010up (MD \u22127.40, 95% CI \u221212.55 to \u22122.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non\u2010radicular low back pain Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non\u2010radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short\u2010term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short\u2010term pain or function. ", "conclusion": " Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short\u2010term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long\u2010term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non\u2010radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited. "}

Seven trials examined only knee osteoarthritis. Two also included participants with hip osteoarthritis. All trials compared antidepressants to placebo, with or without non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs. Trial sizes were 36 to 388 participants. Most participants were female, with mean ages of 54.5 to 65.9 years. Trial durations were 8 to 16 weeks. Six trials examined duloxetine. We combined data from nine trials in meta\u2010analyses for knee and hip osteoarthritis. One trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. Five trials were at risk of attrition and reporting bias. High\u2010certainty evidence found that antidepressants resulted in a clinically unimportant improvement in pain compared to placebo. Mean reduction in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 = no pain) was 1.7 points with placebo and 2.3 points with antidepressants (mean difference (MD) \u22120.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.88 to \u22120.31; 9 trials, 2122 participants). Clinical response was defined as achieving a 50% or greater reduction in 24\u2010hour mean pain. High\u2010certainty evidence demonstrated that 45% of participants receiving antidepressants had a clinical response compared to 28.6% receiving placebo (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.82; 6 RCTs, 1904 participants). This corresponded to an absolute improvement in pain of 16% more responders with antidepressants (8.9% more to 26% more) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 11). High\u2010certainty evidence showed that the mean improvement in function (on 0 to 100 Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, 0 = best function) was 10.51 points with placebo and 16.16 points with antidepressants (MD \u22125.65 points, 95% CI \u22127.08 to \u22124.23; 6 RCTs, 1909 participants). This demonstrates a small, clinically unimportant response. Moderate\u2010certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision) showed that quality of life measured using the EuroQol 5\u2010Dimension scale (\u22120.11 to 1.0, 1.0 = perfect health) improved by 0.07 points with placebo and 0.11 points with antidepressants (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.07; 3 RCTs, 815 participants). This is clinically unimportant. High\u2010certainty evidence showed that total adverse events increased in the antidepressant group (64%) compared to the placebo group (49%) (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.41; 9 RCTs, 2102 participants). The number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 7 (95% CI 5 to 11). Low\u2010certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision for very low numbers of events) found no evidence of a difference in serious adverse events between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.94; 9 RCTs, 2101 participants). The NNTH was 1000.  Moderate\u2010certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision) showed that 11% of participants receiving antidepressants withdrew from trials due to an adverse event compared to 5% receiving placebo (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.97; 6 RCTs, 1977 participants). The NNTH was 17 (95% CI 10 to 35). ", "conclusion": " There is high\u2010certainty evidence that use of antidepressants for knee osteoarthritis leads to a non\u2010clinically important improvement in mean pain and function. However, a small number of people will have a 50% or greater important improvement in pain and function. This finding was consistent across all trials. Pain in osteoarthritis may be due to a variety of causes that differ between individuals. It may be that the cause of pain that responds to this therapy is only present in a small number of people. There is moderate\u2010certainty evidence that antidepressants have a small positive effect on quality of life with heterogeneity between trials. High\u2010certainty evidence indicates antidepressants result in more adverse events and moderate\u2010certainty evidence indicates more withdrawal due to adverse events. There was little to no difference in serious adverse events (low\u2010certainty evidence due to low numbers of events). This suggests that if antidepressants were being considered, there needs to be careful patient selection to optimise clinical benefit given the known propensity for adverse events with antidepressant use. Future trials should include alternative antidepressant agents or phenotyping of pain in people with osteoarthritis, or both. "}

Twelve trials (10,218 participants in total, 2335 of which were children) evaluated a C\u2010reactive protein point\u2010of\u2010care test, and one trial (317 adult participants) evaluated a procalcitonin point\u2010of\u2010care test. The studies were conducted in Europe, Russia, and Asia. Overall, the included trials had a low or unclear risk of bias. However all studies were open\u2010labelled, thereby introducing high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The use of C\u2010reactive protein point\u2010of\u2010care tests to guide antibiotic prescription likely reduces the number of participants given an antibiotic prescription, from 516 prescriptions of antibiotics per 1000 participants in the control group to 397 prescriptions of antibiotics per 1000 participants in the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.86; 12 trials, 10,218 participants; I\u00b2 = 79%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence).  Overall, use of C\u2010reactive protein tests also reduce the number of participants given an antibiotic prescription within 28 days follow\u2010up (664 prescriptions of antibiotics per 1000 participants in the control group versus 538 prescriptions of antibiotics per 1000 participants in the intervention group) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.86; 7 trials, 5091 participants; I\u00b2 = 29; high\u2010certainty evidence). The prescription of antibiotics as guided by C\u2010reactive protein tests likely does not reduce the number of participants recovered, within seven or 28 days follow\u2010up (567 participants recovered within seven days follow\u2010up per 1000 participants in the control group versus 584 participants recovered within seven days follow\u2010up per 1000 participants in the intervention group) (recovery within seven days follow\u2010up: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence) (recovery within 28 days follow\u2010up: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32; I\u00b2 = 0%; moderate\u2010certainty evidence). The use of C\u2010reactive protein tests may not increase total mortality within 28 days follow\u2010up, from 1 death per 1000 participants in the control group to 0 deaths per 1000 participants in the intervention group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.92; I\u00b2 = 0%; low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain as to whether procalcitonin affects any of the primary or secondary outcomes because there were few participants, thereby limiting the certainty of evidence. We assessed the certainty of the evidence as moderate to high according to GRADE for the primary outcomes for C\u2010reactive protein test, except for mortality, as there were very few deaths, thereby limiting the certainty of the evidence. ", "conclusion": " The use of C\u2010reactive protein point\u2010of\u2010care tests as an adjunct to standard care likely reduces the number of participants given an antibiotic prescription in primary care patients who present with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The use of C\u2010reactive protein point\u2010of\u2010care tests likely does not affect recovery rates. It is unlikely that further research will substantially change our conclusion regarding the reduction in number of participants given an antibiotic prescription, although the size of the estimated effect may change.  The use of C\u2010reactive protein point\u2010of\u2010care tests may not increase mortality within 28 days follow\u2010up, but there were very few events. Studies that recorded deaths and hospital admissions were performed in children from low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries and older adults with comorbidities.  Future studies should focus on children, immunocompromised individuals, and people aged 80 years and above with comorbidities.

{"doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD012715.pub2", "abstract": "Objectives:\n To assess the effectiveness of antihistamines in the prevention and treatment of motion sickness in adults and children. \n\nMain results:\n We included nine RCTs (658 participants). Studies were conducted across seven countries, with an overall age range of 16 to 55 years. Motion sickness was induced naturally in six studies and experimentally in four studies (rotating chair). All the naturally induced studies only evaluated first\u2010generation antihistamines (cinnarizine and dimenhydrinate). Risk of bias across the studies varied, with mostly low risk for random sequence generation and allocation concealment, and mostly high risk for selective reporting. Only the experimentally induced studies measured physiological parameters and only the naturally induced studies evaluated adverse effects. There were no studies that clearly assessed the paediatric population. Antihistamines versus placebo or no treatment Antihistamines are probably more effective than placebo at preventing motion sickness symptoms under natural conditions (symptoms prevented: 25% placebo; 40% antihistamines) (risk ratio (RR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 2.66; 3 studies; 240 participants) (moderate\u2010certainty). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on preventing motion sickness under experimental conditions (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% CI \u20100.18 to 0.83; 2 studies; 62 participants) (very low\u2010certainty). No studies reported results on the resolution of existing motion sickness symptoms. Antihistamines may result in little or no difference in gastric tachyarrhythmia under experimental conditions (mean difference (MD) \u20102.2, 95% CI \u201011.71 to 7.31; 1 study; 42 participants) (low\u2010certainty). No studies reported results for any other physiological measures. When compared to placebo, antihistamines may be more likely to cause sedation (sedation: 44% placebo; 66% antihistamines) (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.02; 2 studies; 190 participants) (low\u2010certainty); they may result in little or no difference in blurred vision (blurred vision: 12.5% placebo; 14% antihistamines) (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.48; 2 studies; 190 participants) (low\u2010certainty); and they may result in little or no difference in terms of impaired cognition (impaired cognition: 33% placebo; 29% antihistamines) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.38; 2 studies; 190 participants) (low\u2010certainty). Antihistamines versus scopolamine The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on preventing motion sickness under natural conditions when compared to scopolamine (symptoms prevented: 81% scopolamine; 71% antihistamines) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.16; 2 studies; 71 participants) (very low\u2010certainty). No studies were performed under experimental conditions. No studies reported results on the resolution of existing motion sickness symptoms. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on heart rate under natural conditions (narrative report, 1 study; 20 participants; \"No difference in pulse frequency\"; very low\u2010certainty). No studies reported results for any other physiological measures. When compared to scopolamine, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on sedation (sedation: 21% scopolamine; 30% antihistamines) (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.07 to 9.25; 2 studies; 90 participants) (very low\u2010certainty) and on blurred vision (narrative report: not a significant difference; 1 study; 51 participants; very low\u2010certainty). No studies evaluated impaired cognition. Antihistamines versus antiemetics Antihistamines may result in little or no difference in the prevention of motion sickness under experimental conditions (MD \u20100.20, 95% CI \u201010.91 to 10.51; 1 study; 42 participants) (low\u2010certainty). The evidence is of low certainty due to imprecision as the sample size is small and the confidence interval crosses the line of no effect. No studies assessed the effects of antihistamines versus antiemetics under natural conditions. No studies reported results on the resolution of existing motion sickness symptoms. Antihistamines may result in little or no difference in gastric tachyarrhythmia (MD 4.56, 95% CI \u20103.49 to 12.61; 1 study; 42 participants) (low\u2010certainty). No studies reported results for any other physiological measures. No studies evaluated sedation, impaired cognition or blurred vision. One study reported physiological data for this outcome, evaluating gastric tachyarrhythmia specifically. Antihistamines may result in little or no difference in gastric tachyarrhythmia (MD 4.56, 95% CI \u20103.49 to 12.61; 1 study; 42 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). This evidence is of low certainty due to imprecision as the sample size is small and the confidence interval crosses the line of no effect. Antihistamines versus acupuncture The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of antihistamines on the prevention of motion sickness under experimental conditions when compared to acupuncture (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.57; 1 study; 100 participants) (very low\u2010certainty). This study did not assess the prevention of motion sickness under natural conditions, nor the resolution of existing motion sickness symptoms. There was no study performed under natural conditions. Physiological measures and adverse effects were not reported. ", "conclusion": " There is probably a reduction in the risk of developing motion sickness symptoms under naturally occurring conditions of motion when using first\u2010generation antihistamines, in motion sickness\u2010susceptible adults, compared to placebo. Antihistamines may be more likely to cause sedation when compared to placebo. No studies evaluated the treatment of existing motion sickness, and there are few data on the effect of antihistamines in children. The evidence for all other outcomes and comparisons (versus scopolamine, antiemetics and acupuncture) was of low or very low certainty and we are therefore uncertain about these effects of antihistamines.

One trial included people with hip osteoarthritis, one hip or knee osteoarthritis and 60 included people with knee osteoarthritis only. Thirty\u2010six trials evaluated electrophysical agents, seven manual therapies, four acupuncture or dry needling, or taping, three psychological therapies, dietary interventions or whole body vibration, two spa or peloid therapy and one foot insoles. Twenty\u2010two trials included a placebo adjunctive therapy. We presented the effects stratified by different adjunctive therapies along with the overall results. We judged most trials to be at risk of bias, including 55% at risk of selection bias, 74% at risk of performance bias and 79% at risk of detection bias. Adverse events were reported in 11 (18%) trials. Comparing adjunctive therapies plus land\u2010based exercise therapy against placebo therapies plus exercise up to six months (short\u2010term), we found low\u2010certainty evidence for reduced pain and function, which did not meet our prespecified threshold for a clinically important difference. Mean pain intensity was 5.4 in the placebo group on a 0 to 10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) (lower scores represent less pain), and 0.77 points lower (0.48 points better to 1.16 points better) in the adjunctive therapy and exercise therapy group; relative improvement 10% (6% to 15% better) (22 studies; 1428 participants). Mean physical function on the Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) 0 to 68 physical function (lower scores represent better function) subscale was 32.5 points in the placebo group and reduced by 5.03 points (2.57 points better to 7.61 points better) in the adjunctive therapy and exercise therapy group; relative improvement 12% (6% better to 18% better) (20 studies; 1361 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence indicates that adjunctive therapies did not improve QOL (SF\u201036 0 to 100 scale, higher scores represent better QOL). Placebo group mean QOL was 81.8 points, and 0.75 points worse (4.80 points worse to 3.39 points better) in the placebo adjunctive therapy group; relative improvement 1% (7% worse to 5% better) (two trials; 82 participants). Low\u2010certainty evidence (two trials; 340 participants) indicates adjunctive therapies plus exercise may not increase adverse events compared to placebo therapies plus exercise (31% versus 13%; risk ratio (RR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 21.90). Participant\u2010reported global assessment was not measured in any studies. Compared with land\u2010based exercise therapy, low\u2010certainty evidence indicates that adjunctive electrophysical agents alongside exercise produced short\u2010term (0 to 6 months) pain reduction of 0.41 points (0.17 points better to 0.63 points better); mean pain in the exercise\u2010only group was 3.8 points and 0.41 points better in the adjunctive therapy plus exercise group (0 to 10 NPRS); relative improvement 7% (3% better to 11% better) (41 studies; 3322 participants). Mean physical function (0 to 68 WOMAC subscale) was 18.2 points in the exercise group and 2.83 points better (1.62 points better to 4.04 points better) in the adjunctive therapy plus exercise group; relative improvement 9% (5% better to 13% better) (41 studies; 3323 participants). These results are not clinically important. Mean QOL in the exercise group was 56.1 points and 1.04 points worse in the adjunctive therapies plus exercise therapy group (1.04 points worse to 3.12 points better); relative improvement 2% (2% worse to 5% better) (11 studies; 1483 participants), indicating no benefit (low\u2010certainty evidence). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence indicates that adjunctive therapies plus exercise probably result in a slight increase in participant\u2010reported global assessment (short\u2010term), with success reported by 45% in the exercise therapy group and 17% more individuals receiving adjunctive therapies and exercise (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.62) (5 studies; 840 participants). One study (156 participants) showed little difference in radiographic joint structural changes (0.25 mm less, 95% CI \u20100.32 to \u20100.18 mm); 12% relative improvement (6% better to 18% better). Low\u2010certainty evidence (8 trials; 1542 participants) indicates that adjunctive therapies plus exercise may not increase adverse events compared with exercise only (8.6% versus 6.5%; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.27). ", "conclusion": " Moderate\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence showed no difference in pain, physical function or QOL between adjunctive therapies and placebo adjunctive therapies, or in pain, physical function, QOL or joint structural changes, compared to exercise only. Participant\u2010reported global assessment was not reported for placebo comparisons, but there is probably a slight clinical benefit for adjunctive therapies plus exercise compared with exercise, based on a small number of studies. This may be explained by additional constructs captured in global measures compared with specific measures. Although results indicate no increased adverse events for adjunctive therapies used with exercise, these were poorly reported. Most studies evaluated short\u2010term effects, with limited medium\u2010 or long\u2010term evaluation. Due to a preponderance of knee osteoarthritis trials, we urge caution in extrapolating the findings to populations with hip osteoarthritis. "}

One study conducted in the USA randomized participants to etanercept or placebo (N = 12). Two studies, one conducted in the UK (N = 90) and one in France (N = 32), randomized participants to adalimumab or placebo. All studies were at low risk of bias. Initial pooled estimates suggested that TNF\u2010inhibitors may result in little to no difference on treatment success defined as 0 to trace cells on Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN)\u2010grading; or two\u2010step decrease in activity based on SUN grading (estimated risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 2.10; 2 studies; 43 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) or treatment failure defined as a two\u2010step increase in activity based on SUN grading (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.01 to 7.15; 1 study; 31 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Further analysis using the individual trial definitions of treatment response and failure suggested a positive treatment effect of TNF inhibitors; a RR of treatment success of 2.60 (95% CI 1.30 to 5.20; 3 studies; 124 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence), and RR of treatment failure of 0.23 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.50; 3 studies; 133 participants). Almost all the evidence was on adalimumab and the evidence on etanercept was very limited.  For secondary outcomes, one study suggests that adalimumab may have little to no effect on risk of recurrence after induction of remission at three months (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 20.45; 90 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and visual acuity, but the evidence is very uncertain; mean difference in longitudinal logMAR score change over six months was \u20100.01 (95% CI \u20130.06 to 0.03) and \u20100.02 (95% CI \u20130.07 to 0.03) using the best and worst logMAR measurement, respectively (low\u2010certainty evidence). Low\u2010certainty evidence from one study suggested that adalimumab treatment results in reduction of topical steroid doses at six months (hazard ratio 3.58; 95% CI 1.24 to 10.32; 74 participants who took one or more topical steroid per day at baseline). Adverse events, including injection site reactions and infections, were more common in the TNF inhibitor group. Serious adverse events were uncommon. ", "conclusion": " Adalimumab appears to increase the likelihood of treatment success and decrease the likelihood of treatment failure when compared with placebo. The evidence was less conclusive about a positive treatment effect with etanercept. Adverse events from JIA\u2010U trials are in keeping with the known side effect profile of TNF inhibitors. Standard validated JIA\u2010U outcome measures are required to homogenize assessment and to allow for comparison and analysis of multiple datasets. "}

These were supported by 16 non\u2010RCTs (8237 babies). Five studies had non\u2010commercial funding, three studies stated 'no funding' and 14 studies did not state funding source. The RCTs were generally at unclear risk of bias, although we judged three RCTs to be at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. The non\u2010RCTs were of moderate and critical risk of bias. We did not undertake meta\u2010analysis due to methodological and clinical differences between studies; instead, we have summarised the results narratively.  Dynamic splinting versus delayed or no splinting Four RCTs and nine non\u2010RCTs compared immediate dynamic splinting and delayed dynamic splinting or no splinting. Of the RCTs, two considered stable hips and one considered unstable (dislocatable) hips and one jointly considered unstable and stable hips. No studies considered only dislocated hips. Two RCTs (265 babies, very low\u2010certainty evidence) reported acetabular index at one year amongst stable or dislocatable hips. Both studies found there may be no evidence of a difference in splinting stable hips at first diagnosis compared to a strategy of active surveillance: one reported a mean difference (MD) of 0.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.74 to 0.94), and the other an MD of 0.20 (95% CI \u22121.65 to 2.05). Two RCTs of stable hips (181 babies, very low\u2010certainty evidence) reported there may be no evidence of a difference between groups for acetabular index at two years: one study reported an MD of \u22121.90 (95% CI \u22124.76 to 0.96), and another study reported an MD of \u22120.10 (95% CI \u22121.93 to 1.73), but did not take into account hips from the same child. No study reported data at five years. Four RCTs (434 babies, very low\u2010certainty evidence) reported the need for surgical intervention. Three studies reported that no surgical interventions occurred. In the remaining study, two babies in the dynamic splinting group developed instability and were subsequently treated surgically. This study did not explicitly state if this treatment was to achieve concentric reduction or address residual dysplasia. Three RCTs (390 babies, very low\u2010certainty evidence) reported no complications (avascular necrosis and femoral nerve palsy). Dynamic splinting versus static splinting One RCT and five non\u2010RCTs compared dynamic versus static splinting. The RCT (118 hips) reported no occurrences of avascular necrosis (very low\u2010certainty evidence) and did not report radiological outcomes or need for operative intervention. One quasi\u2010RCT compared double nappies versus delayed or no splinting but reported no outcomes of interest. Other comparisons No RCTs compared static splinting versus delayed or no splinting or staged weaning versus immediate removal. ", "conclusion": " There is a paucity of RCT evidence for splinting for the non\u2010operative management of DDH: we included only six RCTs with 576 babies. Moreover, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies, precluding meta\u2010analysis. We judged the RCT evidence for all primary outcomes as being of very low certainty, meaning we are very uncertain about the true effects. Results from individual studies provide limited evidence of intervention effects on different severities of DDH. Amongst stable dysplastic hips, there was no evidence to suggest that treatment at any stage expedited the development of the acetabulum. For dislocatable hips, a delay in treatment onset to six weeks does not appear to result in any evidence of a difference in the development of the acetabulum at one year or increased risk of surgery. However, delayed splinting may reduce the number of babies requiring treatment with a harness. No RCTs compared static splinting with delayed or no splinting, staged weaning versus immediate removal or double nappies versus delayed or no splinting. There were few operative interventions or complications amongst the RCTs and the non\u2010randomised studies. There's no apparent signal to indicate a higher frequency of either outcome in either intervention group. Given the frequency of this disease, and the fact that many countries undertake mandatory DDH screening, there is a clear need to develop an evidence\u2010based pathway for treatment. Particular uncertainties requiring future research are the effectiveness of splinting amongst stable dysplastic hips, the optimal timing for the onset of splinting, the optimal type of splint to use and the need for 'weaning of splints'. Only once a robust pathway for treatment is established, can we properly assess the cost\u2010effectiveness of screening interventions for DDH. "}

Here, we report the effects for RIMN compared with locking plates. Three studies (221 participants) reported this comparison; it included the largest study population and these are the two most commonly used devices in contemporary orthopaedic trauma practice. Studies used three different tools to assess PROMs. We found very\u2010low certainty evidence for lower Disability Rating Index scores after RIMN at short\u2010term follow\u2010up favouring RIMN (mean difference (MD) \u221221.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u221238.16 to \u22125.64; 1 study, 12 participants) and low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference at long\u2010term follow\u2010up (standardised mean difference (SMD) \u22120.22, 95% CI \u22120.50 to 0.06; 2 studies, 198 participants). Re\u2010expressing the SMD of the long\u2010term follow\u2010up data to Knee Society Score (KSS) used by one study found no clinical benefit of RIMN, based on a minimal clinically important difference of 9 points (MD 2.47, 95% CI \u22126.18 to 0.74). The effect on QoL was very uncertain at four months (MD 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.42 to 0.44; 1 study, 14 participants) and one year (MD 0.10, 95% CI \u22120.01 to 0.21; 1 study, 156 participants); this evidence was very low certainty. For direct adverse events, studies reported reoperation, loss of fixation, superficial and deep infection, haematoma formation and implant loosening. Effects for all events were imprecise with the possibility of benefit or harm for both treatments. We considered reoperation the most clinically relevant. There was very low\u2010certainty evidence of little or no difference in reoperation between the two implants (risk ratio (RR) 1.48, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.00; 1 study, 104 participants).

However, we found no evidence of any important differences between treatments in terms of bony union, indirect adverse events, or resource use.

Most sampled studies were from high\u2010income countries, with four from middle\u2010income and two from low\u2010income countries. In 27 sampled studies, the participants were survivors, in three they were intervention facilitators. Two included all three of our stakeholder groups, and five included two of our groups. The studies explored a wide range of psychosocial interventions, with only one type of intervention explored in more than one study. The review indicates that features associated with the context in which interventions were delivered had an impact on how individuals accessed and experienced interventions. This included organisational features, such as staff turnover, that could influence survivors' engagement with interventions; the setting or location in which interventions were delivered; and the characteristics associated with who delivered the interventions. Studies that assess the effectiveness of interventions typically assess their impact on mental health; however, as well as finding benefits to mental health, our QES found that study participants felt interventions also had positive impacts on their physical health, mood, understanding of trauma, interpersonal relationships and enabled them to re\u2010engage with a wide range of areas in their lives. Participants explained that features of interventions and their contexts that best enabled them to benefit from interventions were also often things that could be a barrier to benefiting from interventions. For example, the relationship with the therapist, when open and warm was a benefit, but if such a relationship could not be achieved, it was a barrier. Survivors' levels of readiness and preparedness to both start and end interventions could have positive (if they were ready) or negative (if they were not) impacts. Study participants identified the potential risks and harms associated with completing interventions but felt that it was important to face and process trauma. Some elements of interventions were specific to the intervention type (e.g. faith\u2010based interventions), or related to an experience of an intervention that held particular relevance to subgroups of survivors (e.g. minority groups); these issues could impact how individuals experienced delivering or receiving interventions. ", "conclusion": " We had high or moderate confidence in all but one of our review findings. Further research in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income settings, with male survivors of sexual abuse and violence and those from minority groups could strengthen the evidence for low and moderate confidence findings. We found that few interventions had published quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Since this QES has highlighted important aspects that could enable interventions to be more suitable for survivors, using a range of methodologies would provide valuable information that could enhance intervention uptake, completion and effectiveness. This study has shown that although survivors often found interventions difficult, they also appreciated that they needed to work through trauma, which they said resulted in a wide range of benefits. Therefore, listening to survivors and providing appropriate interventions, at the right time for them, can make a significant difference to their health and well\u2010being. "}

We included two RCTs in the review. One study focused on the primary prevention of CVD, and the other addressed secondary prevention. We evaluated both as being at high risk of bias. Our primary outcomes of interest were death (all\u2010cause and CVD\u2010related) and all cardiovascular events, measured at one\u2010year follow\u2010up or longer. For primary prevention of CVD in participants with periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, one study (165 participants) provided very low\u2010certainty evidence. There was only one death in the study; we were unable to determine whether scaling and root planning plus amoxicillin and metronidazole could reduce incidence of all\u2010cause death (Peto odds ratio (OR) 7.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 376.98), or all CVD\u2010related death (Peto OR 7.48, 95% CI 0.15 to 376.98). We could not exclude the possibility that scaling and root planning plus amoxicillin and metronidazole could increase cardiovascular events (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 1.07 to 56.1) compared with supragingival scaling measured at 12\u2010month follow\u2010up. For secondary prevention of CVD, one pilot study randomised 303 participants to receive scaling and root planning plus oral hygiene instruction (periodontal treatment) or oral hygiene instruction plus a copy of radiographs and recommendation to follow\u2010up with a dentist (community care). As cardiovascular events had been measured for different time periods of between 6 and 25 months, and only 37 participants were available with at least one\u2010year follow\u2010up, we did not consider the data to be sufficiently robust for inclusion in this review.

There is no reliable evidence available regarding secondary prevention of CVD in people diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and CVD. Further trials are needed to reach conclusions about whether treatment for periodontal disease can help prevent occurrence or recurrence of CVD. "}

This review also aimed to identify adverse events related to upper limb exercise. \n\nMain results:\n Nine studies (579 participants) were included, and seven studies (519 participants) conducting post\u2010operative exercise training could be meta\u2010analysed. Three comparisons were undertaken: (i) isotonic exercise training versus no intervention; (ii) isometric versus isotonic exercise training; and (iii) isotonic (high volume) versus isotonic exercise training (low volume). Due to insufficient data, we could not analyse pre\u2010operative exercise training. Overall, the risk of bias was low for selection and reporting bias, high for performance and attrition bias, and unclear for detection bias. Compared to no intervention, isotonic exercise training may make little or no difference to ultrasound maturation (2 studies, 263 participants: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.25; I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence), but may improve clinical maturation (2 studies, 263 participants: RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27; I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence). Compared to isotonic exercise training, isometric exercise training may improve both ultrasound maturation (3 studies, 160 participants: RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.00; I\u00b2 = 22%; low certainty evidence) and clinical maturation (3 studies, 160 participants: RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.76; I\u00b2 = 53%; low certainty evidence). Venous diameter (3 studies, 160 participants: MD 0.84 mm, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.23; I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) and blood flow in the inflow artery (3 studies, 160 participants: MD 140.62 mL/min, 95% CI 38.72 to 242.52; I\u00b2 = 0%; low certainty evidence) may be greater with isometric exercise training. It is uncertain whether isometric exercise training reduces vascular access complications (2 studies, 110 participants: RR 2.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 17.08; I\u00b2 = 47%; very low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether high volume isotonic exercise training improves venous diameter (2 studies, 93 participants: MD 0.19 mm, 95% CI \u20100.75 to 1.13; I\u00b2 = 34%; very low certainty evidence) or blood flow in the inflow artery (1 study, 15 participants: MD \u2010287.70 mL/min, 95% CI \u2010625.99 to 60.59; very low certainty evidence) compared to low volume isotonic exercise training. None of the included studies reported time to mature, dialysis efficacy indicator, vascular access function, or adverse events.

All trials had methodological limitations, and lack of blinding of participants and investigators was a major source of bias. We had 'some concerns' for the overall risk of bias in all trials.  Electromagnetic\u2010guided postpyloric placement of nasoenteral feeding tubes may result in little to no difference in technical success in insertion compared to endoscopic\u2010guided placement (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35; I 2  = 81%; low\u2010certainty evidence).

Five studies investigated metformin, three topiramate, three H2 antagonists, three monoamine modulators, and one each investigated monoamine modulators plus betahistine, melatonin and samidorphan. The comparator in all studies was placebo or no treatment (i.e. standard care alone). We synthesised all studies in a quantitative meta\u2010analysis. Most studies inadequately reported their methods of allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. The resulting risk of bias and often small sample sizes limited the overall certainty of the evidence. Only one reboxetine study reported the primary outcome, number of participants with clinically important change in weight. Fewer people in the treatment condition experienced weight gains of more than 5% and more than 7% of their bodyweight than those in the placebo group (> 5% weight gain RR 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.65; 1 study, 43 participants; > 7% weight gain RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.83; 1 study, 43 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). No studies reported the primary outcomes, 'clinically important change in BMI', or 'compliance with treatment'. However, several studies reported 'average endpoint/change in body weight' or 'average endpoint/change in BMI'. Metformin may be effective in preventing weight gain (MD \u22124.03 kg, 95% CI \u22125.78 to \u22122.28; 4 studies, 131 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence); and BMI increase (MD \u22121.63 kg/m2, 95% CI \u22122.96 to \u22120.29; 5 studies, 227 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence).

We included three additional RCTs: two paediatric and one adult. Therefore, we included a total of 13 eligible RCTs (five paediatric and eight adult). The studies enrolled 1252 children with leukaemia, lymphoma or a solid tumour and 1269 participants, who were mostly diagnosed with breast cancer. In adults, moderate\u2010quality evidence showed that there was less clinical heart failure with the use of dexrazoxane (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.43; 7 studies, 1221 adults). In children, we identified no difference in clinical heart failure risk between treatment groups (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.19; 3 studies, 885 children; low\u2010quality evidence). In three paediatric studies assessing cardiomyopathy/heart failure as the primary cause of death, none of the children had this outcome (1008 children, low\u2010quality evidence). In the adult studies, different definitions for subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were used, but pooled analyses were possible: there was a benefit in favour of the use of dexrazoxane (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.56; 3 studies, 417 adults and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66; 2 studies, 534 adults, respectively, moderate\u2010quality evidence). In the paediatric studies, definitions of subclinical myocardial dysfunction and clinical heart failure combined were incomparable, making pooling impossible. One paediatric study showed a benefit in favour of dexrazoxane (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.85; 33 children; low\u2010quality evidence), whereas another study showed no difference between treatment groups (Fischer exact P = 0.12; 537 children; very low\u2010quality evidence). Overall survival (OS) was reported in adults and overall mortality in children. The meta\u2010analyses of both outcomes showed no difference between treatment groups (hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% 0.88 to 1.23; 4 studies; moderate\u2010quality evidence; and HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.42; 3 studies, 1008 children; low\u2010quality evidence, respectively). Progression\u2010free survival (PFS) was only reported in adults. We subdivided PFS into three analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified a longer PFS in favour of dexrazoxane in one study (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.90; 164 adults; low\u2010quality evidence). There was no difference between treatment groups in the other two analyses (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40; 1 study; low\u2010quality evidence; and HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.43; 2 studies; moderate\u2010quality evidence, respectively). In adults, there was no difference in tumour response rate between treatment groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04; 6 studies, 956 adults; moderate\u2010quality evidence). We subdivided tumour response rate in children into two analyses based on the comparability of definitions, and identified no difference between treatment groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 1 study, 206 children; very low\u2010quality evidence; and RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 1 study, 200 children; low\u2010quality evidence, respectively). The occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN) was only assessed in children. The available and worst\u2010case analyses were identical and showed a difference in favour of the control group (RR 3.08, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.38; 3 studies, 1015 children; low\u2010quality evidence). In the best\u2010case analysis, the direction of effect was the same, but there was no difference between treatment groups (RR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.53; 4 studies, 1220 children; low\u2010quality evidence). For other adverse effects, results also varied. None of the studies evaluated quality of life. If not reported, the number of participants for an analysis was unclear. ", "conclusion": " Our meta\u2010analyses showed the efficacy of dexrazoxane in preventing or reducing cardiotoxicity in adults treated with anthracyclines. In children, there was a difference between treatment groups for one cardiac outcome (i.e. for one of the definitions used for clinical heart failure and subclinical myocardial dysfunction combined) in favour of dexrazoxane. In adults, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate, OS and PFS was identified; and in children, no evidence of a negative effect on tumour response rate and overall mortality was identified. The results for adverse effects varied. In children, dexrazoxane may be associated with a higher risk of SMN; in adults this was not addressed. In adults, the quality of the evidence ranged between moderate and low; in children, it ranged between low and very low. Before definitive conclusions on the use of dexrazoxane can be made, especially in children, more high\u2010quality research is needed. We conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in children and adults with cancer who are treated with anthracyclines. However, clinicians and patients should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects, including SMN, for each individual. For children, the International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group has developed a clinical practice guideline. "}
